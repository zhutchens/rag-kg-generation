Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it.

Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

REASON: The score is 0.92 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. For example, the first node discusses 'proving the uncountability of sets,' which is relevant, while the third node, which is about 'random number generation,' is irrelevant and ranked lower. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the fifth node about 'identifying random sequences,' are ranked higher than they should be.

REASON: The score is 0.40 because only 2 out of 5 sentences in the expected output are supported by the nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, the understanding of logarithms is linked to the 2nd node, and proof techniques are linked to the 1st node. However, there is no direct support for understanding sets, set notation, or summations and recurrences in the retrieval context.

However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST).

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.7265536139153655 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.73 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are generally ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the eighth node which 'provides a code snippet for dequeue operation but does not contribute to understanding the key learning outcomes of lists, stacks, or queues,' and the ninth node which 'discusses the time complexity of list operations, which is not directly relevant to the key learning outcomes of lists, stacks, or queues,' are ranked above relevant nodes. This affects the overall precision of the ranking.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement.

In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list.

The relevant context can be found here: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement.

In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements.

Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers.

Variable temp stores the top nodes’ value, while ltemp links to the top node as it is removed from the stack. The stack is updated by setting top to point to the next link in the stack.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.5957656926406926 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.60 because several relevant nodes are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node in the retrieval context discusses 'the differences between full and complete binary trees,' which is not directly related to the learning outcomes, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Similarly, the third node provides 'a specific theorem about the number of empty subtrees,' which is too specific and not directly related to the broader learning outcomes, but it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. However, the score is not lower because some relevant nodes, such as the second node covering 'a wide range of topics related to binary trees,' are correctly ranked higher.

This is because a binary tree is not merely a restricted form of general tree with at most two children. Every binary tree node has a left and a right child, though either or both might be empty. For example, the representation of Exam- ple 6.8 cannot let us distinguish whether node D in Figure 6.17 is the left or right child of node B. 36.6 Further Reading', 'The previous section points out that a large fraction of the space in a typical binary tree node implementation is devoted to structural overhead, not to storing data. This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5.

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', '7.3 The Bubble Sort implementation has the following inner for loop: 3for (int j=n-1; j>i; j--) 3Consider the effect of replacing this with the following statement: 3for (int j=n-1; j>0; j--) 3Would the new implementation work correctly?

Selection Sort is particularly 3229 3230', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort.

Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved.

For each one, describe either why it is or is not stable. If a minor change to the implemen- tation would make it stable, describe the change.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms 3This section presents three simple sorting algorithms.

REASON: The score is 0.50 because while the nodes in retrieval context support understanding and empirical comparison of sorting algorithms (related to sentences 1 and 4), they do not cover implementation on sorted/unsorted lists or the divide-and-conquer technique (related to sentences 2 and 3).

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', '7.3 The Bubble Sort implementation has the following inner for loop: 3for (int j=n-1; j>i; j--) 3Consider the effect of replacing this with the following statement: 3for (int j=n-1; j>0; j--) 3Would the new implementation work correctly? Would the change affect the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm? How would the change affect the running time of the algorithm?', 'lowindex = j; 3// Put it in place 3DSutil.swap(A, i, lowindex); 3} 3} 3Selection Sort (as written here) is essentially a Bubble Sort, except that rather than repeatedly swapping adjacent values to get the next smallest record into place, we instead remember the position of the element to be selected and do one swap at the end. Thus, the number of comparisons is still Θ(n2), but the number of swaps is much less than that required by bubble sort. Selection Sort is particularly 3229 3230', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array. If the pivot values are selected at random, then this is extremely unlikely to happen. When selecting the middle position of the current subarray, it 32The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', '9.2 Modify the binary search routine of Section 3.5 to implement interpolation search.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position.

This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', 'We use binary insert to place the losers. However, we are free to choose the best ordering for inserting, keeping in mind the fact that binary search has the same cost for 2i through 2i+1 − 1 items. For example, binary search requires three comparisons in the worst case for lists of size 4, 5, 6, or 7. So we pick the order of inserts to optimize the binary searches, which means picking an order that avoids growing a sublist size such that it crosses the boundary on list size to require an additional comparison. This sort is called merge insert sort, and also known as the Ford and Johnson sort.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1. Run your implementations over a large range of problem sizes, timing the results for each algorithm. Graph and compare these timing results. 3Sec. 9.7 Projects', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', 'This probably sounds convoluted to do two levels of jumping to be followed by a sequential search. While it might make sense to do a two-level algorithm (that is, jump search jumps to ﬁnd a sublist and then does sequential search on the sublist), it almost never seems to make sense to do a three-level algorithm. Instead, when we go beyond two levels, we nearly always generalize by using recursion. This leads us to the most commonly used search algorithm for sorted arrays, the binary search described in Section 3.5.', '3.20 It is possible to change the way that we pick the dividing point in a binary search, and still get a working search routine. However, where we pick the dividing point could affect the performance of the algorithm.', 'Sec. 5.4 Binary Search Trees 3Right sibling(r) = r + 1 if r is odd and r + 1 < n. 35.4 Binary Search Trees', '9.5 Graph the equations T(n) = log2 n and T(n) = n/ loge n. Which gives the better performance, binary search on a sorted list, or sequential search on a list ordered by frequency where the frequency conforms to a Zipf distribu- tion? Characterize the difference in running times.', 'Because the sequential search algorithm is both in O(n) and in Ω(n) in the 3average case, we say it is Θ(n) in the average case.'].

The relevant context can be found here: ['Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record.

Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'A drawback to this approach is that the array must be of ﬁxed size, which imposes an upper limit on the number of primary keys that might be associated with a particular secondary key. Furthermore, those secondary keys with fewer records than the width of the array will waste the remainder of their row. A better approach is to have a one-dimensional array of secondary key values, where each secondary key is associated with a linked list. This works well if the index is stored in main memory, but not so well when it is stored on disk because the linked list for a given key might be scattered across several disk blocks.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3JonesSmithZukowskiAA10AX33ZQ99AB12AX35AB39ZX45FF37 3Figure 10.3 A two-dimensional linear index.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsFaithfulness ---> SCORE: 0.9 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.90 because the actual output inaccurately claims that the ISAM method has limitations for large databases, while the retrieval context only mentions its adequacy for a limited number of updates without specifically addressing large databases.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: ['Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record.

Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'A drawback to this approach is that the array must be of ﬁxed size, which imposes an upper limit on the number of primary keys that might be associated with a particular secondary key. Furthermore, those secondary keys with fewer records than the width of the array will waste the remainder of their row. A better approach is to have a one-dimensional array of secondary key values, where each secondary key is associated with a linked list. This works well if the index is stored in main memory, but not so well when it is stored on disk because the linked list for a given key might be scattered across several disk blocks.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3JonesSmithZukowskiAA10AX33ZQ99AB12AX35AB39ZX45FF37 3Figure 10.3 A two-dimensional linear index.

The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record.

REASON: The score is 0.88 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node provides a fundamental understanding of indexing with key/pointer pairs, which is crucial for the learning outcomes. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the sixth node discussing 'sorting and organizing records using tree structures' and the seventh node on 'limitations of arrays for secondary keys', are ranked above relevant nodes like the ninth node, which explains 'inverted lists and secondary key indexing'.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements.

Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.8583333333333332 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.86 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'the structure of array-based lists,' which is relevant, while the fourth node, which is irrelevant, 'provides code snippets and does not directly relate to the expected learning outcomes.' However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the fifth node discussing 'search and insertion times in lists,' are ranked relatively high, which affects the precision.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lower Bounds. The relevant context can be found here: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'This section presents one of the most important and most useful proofs in com- puter science: No sorting algorithm based on key comparisons can possibly be faster than Ω(n log n) in the worst case. This proof is important for three reasons. First, knowing that widely used sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal is re- assuring. In particular, it means that you need not bang your head against the wall searching for an O(n) sorting algorithm (or at least not one in any way based on key comparisons). Second, this proof is one of the few non-trivial lower-bounds proofs that we have for any problem; that is, this proof provides one of the relatively few instances where our lower bound is tighter than simply measuring the size of the input and output. As such, it provides a useful model for proving lower bounds on other problems. Finally, knowing a lower bound for sorting gives us a lower bound in turn for other problems whose solution could be used as the basis for a sorting algorithm. The process of deriving asymptotic bounds for one problem from the asymptotic bounds of another is called a reduction, a concept further explored in Chapter 17.', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Theorem 15.1 The lower bound for the problem of searching in an unsorted list is n comparisons. 33Recalling the advice to be suspicious of any lower bounds proof that argues a given behavior “must” happen, this proof should be raising red ﬂags. However, in this particular case the problem is so constrained that there really is no (better) alternative to this particular sequence of events. 3Sec. 15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3Here is our ﬁrst attempt at proving the theorem.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater?

For example, the first node discusses 'the distinction between upper and lower bounds,' which is relevant, while the fifth node, which is less relevant, discusses 'reductions and their use in proving lower bounds.'

And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'With divide and conquer, the best algorithm is the one that minimizes the work, not necessarily the one that balances the input sizes. One lesson to learn from this example is that it can be important to pay attention to what happens for small sizes of n, because any division of the list will eventually produce many small lists. 3We can model all possible divide-and-conquer strategies for this problem with 3the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', 'We will start by considering a simple divide-and-conquer approach to ﬁnding the minimum and maximum. Split the list into two parts and ﬁnd the minimum and maximum elements in each part. Then compare the two minimums and maximums to each other with a further two comparisons to get the ﬁnal result. The algorithm is shown in Figure 15.3. 3The cost of this algorithm can be modeled by the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance.

Tree structures are an example of this. Thus, the algorithms to manipulate such data structures are often presented recursively. Many searching and sorting algorithms are based on a strategy of divide and con- quer. That is, a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion. Thus, recursion plays an important role throughout this book, and many more examples of recursive functions will be given.', 'There are many approaches to solving recurrence relations, and we brieﬂy con- sider three here. The ﬁrst is an estimation technique: Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove the bounds, and tighten as re- quired. The second approach is to expand the recurrence to convert it to a summa- tion and then use summation techniques. The third approach is to take advantage of already proven theorems when the recurrence is of a suitable form. In particu- lar, typical divide and conquer algorithms such as Mergesort yield recurrences of a form that ﬁts a pattern for which we have a ready solution.', 'Those who are unfamiliar with recursion might ﬁnd it hard to accept that it is used primarily as a tool for simplifying the design and description of algorithms. A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'The ﬁrst method of organized graph traversal is called depth-ﬁrst search (DFS). Whenever a vertex V is visited during the search, DFS will recursively visit all of V’s unvisited neighbors. Equivalently, DFS will add all edges leading out of v to a stack. The next vertex to be visited is determined by popping the stack and following that edge. The effect is to follow one branch through the graph to its conclusion, then it will back up and follow another branch, and so on. The DFS process can be used to deﬁne a depth-ﬁrst search tree. This tree is composed of the edges that were followed to any new (unvisited) vertex during the traversal, and leaves out the edges that lead to already visited vertices. DFS can be applied to directed or undirected graphs. Here is an implementation for the DFS algorithm:', 'But isn’t the strategy design pattern doing the same thing? The difference be- tween the visitor pattern and the strategy pattern is more subtle. Here the difference is primarily one of intent and focus.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsAnswer Relevancy ---> SCORE: 0.9 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.90 because the response is highly relevant to the input, focusing on the key learning outcomes related to divide-and-conquer strategies and sorting algorithms. However, it includes a mention of design patterns, which is not directly relevant to the chapter's focus, preventing a perfect score.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Patterns of Algorithms. The relevant context can be found here: ['7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'With divide and conquer, the best algorithm is the one that minimizes the work, not necessarily the one that balances the input sizes. One lesson to learn from this example is that it can be important to pay attention to what happens for small sizes of n, because any division of the list will eventually produce many small lists. 3We can model all possible divide-and-conquer strategies for this problem with 3the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', 'We will start by considering a simple divide-and-conquer approach to ﬁnding the minimum and maximum. Split the list into two parts and ﬁnd the minimum and maximum elements in each part. Then compare the two minimums and maximums to each other with a further two comparisons to get the ﬁnal result. The algorithm is shown in Figure 15.3. 3The cost of this algorithm can be modeled by the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for', 'disk processing, see ﬁle processing divide and conquer, 237, 240, 242, 304, 3467, 472–474 3document retrieval, 314, 335 double buffering, 275, 287, 288 dynamic array, see array, dynamic dynamic memory allocation, 100 dynamic programming, 509–515, 532, 3553 3efﬁciency, xiii, 3–5 element, 23 3homogeneity, 94, 112 3implementation, 111–112', 'Many data structures are naturally recursive, in that they can be deﬁned as be- ing made up of self-similar parts. Tree structures are an example of this. Thus, the algorithms to manipulate such data structures are often presented recursively. Many searching and sorting algorithms are based on a strategy of divide and con- quer. That is, a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion. Thus, recursion plays an important role throughout this book, and many more examples of recursive functions will be given.', 'There are many approaches to solving recurrence relations, and we brieﬂy con- sider three here. The ﬁrst is an estimation technique: Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove the bounds, and tighten as re- quired. The second approach is to expand the recurrence to convert it to a summa- tion and then use summation techniques. The third approach is to take advantage of already proven theorems when the recurrence is of a suitable form. In particu- lar, typical divide and conquer algorithms such as Mergesort yield recurrences of a form that ﬁts a pattern for which we have a ready solution.', 'Those who are unfamiliar with recursion might ﬁnd it hard to accept that it is used primarily as a tool for simplifying the design and description of algorithms. A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'The ﬁrst method of organized graph traversal is called depth-ﬁrst search (DFS). Whenever a vertex V is visited during the search, DFS will recursively visit all of V’s unvisited neighbors. Equivalently, DFS will add all edges leading out of v to a stack. The next vertex to be visited is determined by popping the stack and following that edge. The effect is to follow one branch through the graph to its conclusion, then it will back up and follow another branch, and so on. The DFS process can be used to deﬁne a depth-ﬁrst search tree. This tree is composed of the edges that were followed to any new (unvisited) vertex during the traversal, and leaves out the edges that lead to already visited vertices. DFS can be applied to directed or undirected graphs. Here is an implementation for the DFS algorithm:', 'But isn’t the strategy design pattern doing the same thing?

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Patterns of Algorithms. The relevant context can be found here: ['7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'With divide and conquer, the best algorithm is the one that minimizes the work, not necessarily the one that balances the input sizes. One lesson to learn from this example is that it can be important to pay attention to what happens for small sizes of n, because any division of the list will eventually produce many small lists. 3We can model all possible divide-and-conquer strategies for this problem with 3the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', 'We will start by considering a simple divide-and-conquer approach to ﬁnding the minimum and maximum. Split the list into two parts and ﬁnd the minimum and maximum elements in each part. Then compare the two minimums and maximums to each other with a further two comparisons to get the ﬁnal result. The algorithm is shown in Figure 15.3. 3The cost of this algorithm can be modeled by the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).

Tree structures are an example of this. Thus, the algorithms to manipulate such data structures are often presented recursively. Many searching and sorting algorithms are based on a strategy of divide and con- quer. That is, a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion. Thus, recursion plays an important role throughout this book, and many more examples of recursive functions will be given.', 'There are many approaches to solving recurrence relations, and we brieﬂy con- sider three here. The ﬁrst is an estimation technique: Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove the bounds, and tighten as re- quired. The second approach is to expand the recurrence to convert it to a summa- tion and then use summation techniques. The third approach is to take advantage of already proven theorems when the recurrence is of a suitable form.

The next vertex to be visited is determined by popping the stack and following that edge. The effect is to follow one branch through the graph to its conclusion, then it will back up and follow another branch, and so on. The DFS process can be used to deﬁne a depth-ﬁrst search tree. This tree is composed of the edges that were followed to any new (unvisited) vertex during the traversal, and leaves out the edges that lead to already visited vertices. DFS can be applied to directed or undirected graphs. Here is an implementation for the DFS algorithm:', 'But isn’t the strategy design pattern doing the same thing?

Both approaches can make use of the visitor design pattern to avoid rewriting the traversal function many times, by encapsulating the activity performed at each node.', 'We can make better use of this space and at the same time greatly reduce the number of passes needed to merge the runs if we merge several runs at a time. Multiway merging is similar to two-way merging. If we have B runs to merge, with a block from each run available in memory, then the B-way merge algorithm simply looks at B values (the front-most value for each input run) and selects the smallest one to output. This value is removed from its run, and the process is repeated. When the current block for any run is exhausted, the next block from that run is read from disk. Figure 8.10 illustrates a multiway merge.', 'We could write a separate traversal function for each such activity that we in- tend to perform on the tree. A better approach would be to write a generic traversal function, and pass in the activity to be performed at each node. This organization constitutes the visitor design pattern.

A detailed example for using the Composite design pattern is presented in Section 5.3.1. 31.3.4 Strategy', 'Example 14.2 Solve the summation 3n (cid:88) 31/2i. 3i=1 3We will begin by writing out a table listing the ﬁrst few values of the sum- mation, to see if we can detect a pattern. 3n 3f (n) 31 − f (n) 31 1 2 1 2 32 3 4 1 4 33 7 8 1 8 34 15 16 1 16 35 31 32 1 32 36 63 64 1 64 3Sec. 14.1 Summation Techniques', 'One of the biggest challenges to understanding design patterns is that some- times one is only subtly different from another. For example, you might be con- fused about the difference between the composite pattern and the visitor pattern. The distinction is that the composite design pattern is about whether to give control of the traversal process to the nodes of the tree or to the tree itself. Both approaches can make use of the visitor design pattern to avoid rewriting the traversal function many times, by encapsulating the activity performed at each node.', 'We can make better use of this space and at the same time greatly reduce the number of passes needed to merge the runs if we merge several runs at a time. Multiway merging is similar to two-way merging. If we have B runs to merge, with a block from each run available in memory, then the B-way merge algorithm simply looks at B values (the front-most value for each input run) and selects the smallest one to output. This value is removed from its run, and the process is repeated. When the current block for any run is exhausted, the next block from that run is read from disk. Figure 8.10 illustrates a multiway merge.', 'We could write a separate traversal function for each such activity that we in- tend to perform on the tree. A better approach would be to write a generic traversal function, and pass in the activity to be performed at each node. This organization constitutes the visitor design pattern. The visitor design pattern is used in Sec- tions 5.2 (tree traversal) and 11.3 (graph traversal). 31.3.3 Composite', 'The Strategy design pattern can be used to create generalized sorting functions. The sorting function can be called with an additional parameter. This parameter is a class that understands how to extract and compare the key values for records to be sorted. In this way, the sorting function does not need to know any details of how its record type is implemented.', 'viii 310.5.2 B-Tree Analysis 310.6 Further Reading 10.7 Exercises 10.8 Projects 3IV Advanced Data Structures 311 Graphs 311.1 Terminology and Representations 11.2 Graph Implementations 11.3 Graph Traversals 311.3.1 Depth-First Search 11.3.2 Breadth-First Search 11.3.3 Topological Sort 11.4 Shortest-Paths Problems 311.4.1 Single-Source Shortest Paths 311.5 Minimum-Cost Spanning Trees 11.5.1 Prim’s Algorithm 11.5.2 Kruskal’s Algorithm 311.6 Further Reading 11.7 Exercises 11.8 Projects', 'INDEX 3image space, 430 key space, 430 object space, 429 3depth-ﬁrst search, 371, 383–385, 400, 3424, 482 3deque, 141 dequeue, see queue, dequeue design pattern, xiv, 12–16, 19 3composite, 14–15, 158, 451 ﬂyweight, 13, 158, 192, 450–451 strategy, 15–16, 138 visitor, 13–14, 152, 383, 402 Deutsch-Schorr-Waite algorithm, 425, 3428 3dictionary, xiv, 163, 329, 431 3ADT, 131–137, 301, 339, 368, 509 3Dijkstra’s algorithm, 390–394, 400, 3401, 514 3Diminishing Increment Sort, see 3Shellsort', '469–470, 509 3FIFO list, 125 ﬁle access, 282–283 ﬁle manager, 268, 270, 274, 414, 415, 3421 3ﬁle processing, 80, 224, 295 ﬁle structure, 9, 267, 341, 365 ﬁrst ﬁt, see memory management, ﬁrst 3ﬁt 3ﬂoor function, 28 ﬂoppy disk drive, 269 Floyd’s algorithm, 513–515, 532, 535 ﬂyweight, see design pattern, ﬂyweight fragmentation, 271, 274, 415, 419–421 3external, 415 internal, 271, 415 3free store, 107–108 3575 3576 3free tree, 373, 393, 399 freelist, 117, 120 full binary tree theorem, 147–149, 160,'].

Obviously, it is not possible to write out something that does not exist, but here is a plausible sketch of what a function to solve the Halting Problem might look like if it did exist. Function halt takes two inputs: a string representing the source code for a program or function, and another string representing the input that we wish to determine if the input program or function halts on. Function halt does some work to make a decision (which is encapsulated into some ﬁctitious function named PROGRAM HALTS).

Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I.

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first 16 nodes provide detailed insights into the chapter's key concepts, such as 'the unsolvability of the Halting Problem', 'NP-completeness', and 'Turing machines', which are crucial for understanding the limits of computation. The last two nodes, ranked 17th and 18th, discuss 'general concepts of problems, algorithms, and programs' and 'problem-solving strategies', which are not directly relevant to the chapter's learning outcomes, thus appropriately ranked lower.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Recall ---> SCORE: 0.8571428571428571 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.86 because most sentences in the expected output are well-supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as the 1st node covering problem reduction, NP classification, and impossible problems, and the 15th node discussing Turing Machines. However, one sentence is too vague to be directly linked to any specific node, slightly lowering the score.

After all, does it really matter if no program can compute a “nonsense” function such as shown in Bin 4 of Figure 17.7? Now we will prove that the Halting Problem cannot be computed by any computer program. The proof is by contradiction.', '555 3556 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3we cannot analyze. This comes as a result of the fact that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. 317.3.1 Uncountability 3Before proving that the Halting Problem is unsolvable, we ﬁrst prove that not all functions can be implemented as a computer program. This must be so because the number of programs is much smaller than the number of possible functions.', '559 3560 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3that is, it halts. Thus, contrary does the contrary of what halt says that it will do. 3The action of contrary is logically inconsistent with the assumption that halt solves the Halting Problem correctly. There are no other assumptions we made that might cause this inconsistency. Thus, by contradiction, we have proved that halt cannot solve the Halting Problem correctly, and thus there is no program that can solve the Halting Problem.', '17.4 Further Reading 3The classic text on the theory of N P-completeness is Computers and Intractabil- ity: A Guide to the Theory of N P-completeness by Garey and Johnston [GJ79]. The Traveling Salesman Problem, edited by Lawler et al. [LLKS85], discusses 3561 3562 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3many approaches to ﬁnding an acceptable solution to this particular N P-complete problem in a reasonable amount of time.', 'We begin by assuming that there is a function named halt that can solve the Halting Problem. Obviously, it is not possible to write out something that does not exist, but here is a plausible sketch of what a function to solve the Halting Problem might look like if it did exist. Function halt takes two inputs: a string representing the source code for a program or function, and another string representing the input that we wish to determine if the input program or function halts on. Function halt does some work to make a decision (which is encapsulated into some ﬁctitious function named PROGRAM HALTS). Function halt then returns true if the input program or function does halt on the given input, and false otherwise.', 'Example 17.4 Consider the following variation on the Halting Problem. Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', 'The theory of N P-completeness gives a technique for separating tractable from (probably) intractable problems. Recalling the algorithm for generating algorithms in Section 15.1, we can reﬁne it for problems that we suspect are N P-complete. When faced with a new problem, we might alternate between checking if it is tractable (that is, we try to ﬁnd a polynomial-time solution) and checking if it is intractable (we try to prove the problem is N P-complete). While proving that some problem is N P-complete does not actually make our upper bound for our', '17.19 Prove, using a reduction argument such as given in Section 17.3.2, that the problem of determining whether there is some input on which two arbitrary programs will both halt is unsolvable. 317.20 Prove, using a reduction argument such as given in Section 17.3.2, that the problem of determining whether an arbitrary program halts on all inputs is unsolvable.', 'So a crucial ﬁrst step to getting this whole theory off the ground is ﬁnding one problem that is N P-hard. The ﬁrst proof that a problem is N P-hard (and because it is in N P, therefore N P-complete) was done by Stephen Cook. For this feat, Cook won the ﬁrst Turing award, which is the closest Computer Science equivalent to the Nobel Prize. The “grand-daddy” N P-complete problem that Cook used is call SATISFIABILITY (or SAT for short).', 'We conclude that K-CLIQUE is N P-hard, therefore N P-complete.

Traveling salesmen need to ﬁnd reasonable sales routes regardless of the complexity of the problem. What do you do when faced with an N P-complete problem that you must solve?', 'Example 17.5 For arbitrary program P, does there exist any input for which P halts? Proof: This problem is also uncomputable. Assume that we had a function Ahalt that, when given program P as input would determine if there is some input for which P halts. We could modify our compiler (or write 3Sec. 17.4 Further Reading', '17.17 Prove, using a reduction argument such as given in Section 17.3.2, that the problem of determining if an arbitrary program executes a particular state- ment within that program is unsolvable. 317.18 Prove, using a reduction argument such as given in Section 17.3.2, that the problem of determining if two arbitrary programs halt on exactly the same inputs is unsolvable.', 'Not all problems requiring exponential time on a regular computer are in N P. For example, Towers of Hanoi is not in N P, because it must print out O(2n) moves for n disks. A non-deterministic machine cannot “guess” and print the correct answer in less time. 3On the other hand, consider the TRAVELING SALESMAN problem. 3TRAVELING SALESMAN (1) 3Input: A complete, directed graph G with positive distances assigned to 3each edge in the graph.', 'Problems that are solvable in polynomial time on a regular computer are said to be in class P. Clearly, all problems in P are solvable in polynomial time on a non-deterministic computer simply by neglecting to use the non-deterministic capability. Some problems in N P are N P-complete. We can consider all problems solvable in exponential time or better as an even bigger class of problems because all problems solvable in polynomial time are solvable in exponential time. Thus, we can view the world of exponential-time-or-better problems in terms of Figure 17.5. The most important unanswered question in theoretical computer science is whether P = N P. If they are equal, then there is a polynomial time algorithm', 'Turing machines are a simple model of computation for writing programs that are language acceptors. There is a “universal” Turing machine that can take as in- put a description for a Turing machine, and an input string, and return the execution of that machine on that string. This Turing machine in turn can be cast as a Boolean expression such that the expression is satisﬁable if and only if the Turing machine yields ACCEPT for that string. Cook used Turing machines in his proof because they are simple enough that he could develop this transformation of Turing ma- chines to Boolean expressions, but rich enough to be able to compute any function that a regular computer can compute. The signiﬁcance of this transformation is that any decision problem that is performable by the Turing machine is transformable to SAT. Thus, SAT is N P-hard.', '1.4 Problems, Algorithms, and Programs 3Programmers commonly deal with problems, algorithms, and computer programs. These are three distinct concepts.', 'The claim that all modern programming languages can implement the same algorithms (stated more precisely, any function that is computable by one program- ming language is computable by any programming language with certain standard capabilities) is a key result from computability theory.
