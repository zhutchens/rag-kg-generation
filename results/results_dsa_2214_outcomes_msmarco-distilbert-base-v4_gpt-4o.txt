Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

REASON: The actual output covers asymptotic analysis, notation differences, and empirical testing, aligning partially with the expected output. However, it includes additional details not present in the expected output, such as specific cases and growth rates, and lacks direct mentions of algorithm run time factors and growth rate differences.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.7625803489439853 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.76 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. For example, the first node discusses 'empirical testing of sorting algorithms,' which is relevant, while the second node, which 'primarily lists topics,' is irrelevant and ranked lower. However, some irrelevant nodes, like the ninth node that 'discusses examples of algorithm analysis but does not directly relate,' are still ranked relatively high, preventing a perfect score.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'The linked stack implementation is quite simple. The freelist of Section 4.1.2 is an example of a linked stack. Elements are inserted and removed only from the head of the list. A header node is not used because no special-case code is required for lists of zero or one elements. Figure 4.20 shows the complete linked stack implementation. The only data member is top, a pointer to the ﬁrst (top) link node of the stack. Method push ﬁrst modiﬁes the next ﬁeld of the newly created link node to point to the top of the stack and then sets top to point to the new link node. Method pop is also quite simple. Variable temp stores the top nodes’ value, while ltemp links to the top node as it is removed from the stack. The stack is updated by setting top to point to the next link in the stack. The old top node is then returned to free store (or the freelist), and the element value is returned.', '4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list. The linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed. 3A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list. Because a list node is a distinct object (as opposed to simply a cell in an array), it is good practice to make a separate list node class.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'The linked stack implementation is quite simple. The freelist of Section 4.1.2 is an example of a linked stack. Elements are inserted and removed only from the head of the list. A header node is not used because no special-case code is required for lists of zero or one elements. Figure 4.20 shows the complete linked stack implementation. The only data member is top, a pointer to the ﬁrst (top) link node of the stack. Method push ﬁrst modiﬁes the next ﬁeld of the newly created link node to point to the top of the stack and then sets top to point to the new link node. Method pop is also quite simple. Variable temp stores the top nodes’ value, while ltemp links to the top node as it is removed from the stack. The stack is updated by setting top to point to the next link in the stack. The old top node is then returned to free store (or the freelist), and the element value is returned.', '4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list. The linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed. 3A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.921875 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.92 because most relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node in the retrieval context explains the 'FIFO principle of queues', which is directly relevant, while the seventh node provides a 'general definition of data structures', which is not specifically relevant. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, like the ninth node that 'provides implementation details of a stack', are ranked above relevant nodes, such as the sixteenth node that 'provides details on queue operations'.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end.

In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time.

REASON: The score is 0.61 because relevant nodes are interspersed with irrelevant ones. For example, the third node focuses on 'external sorting, which is not directly relevant to the internal sorting learning outcomes,' yet it is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. Similarly, the fourth node discusses 'a specific anomaly in Selection Sort, which is not directly related to the broader learning outcomes,' and should be ranked lower. However, the score is not lower because some relevant nodes, like the first and second, which discuss 'various sorting algorithms and their implementations' and 'Shellsort,' are correctly ranked higher.

Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage. Assume that we have R runs to merge. If a simple two-way merge is used, then R runs (regardless of their sizes) will require log R passes through 3Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3InputMemoryOutput1612291614192125295631143525312140295621405640212531291612564031251921252156314019191921253156402914', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements.

As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1. Run your implementations over a large range of problem sizes, timing the results for each algorithm. Graph and compare these timing results. 3Sec. 9.7 Projects', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', '9.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 3The simplest form of search has already been presented in Example 3.1: the se- quential search algorithm. Sequential search on an unsorted list requires Θ(n) time in the worst case.', 'We can categorize search algorithms into three general approaches: 31. Sequential and list methods. 2. Direct access by key value (hashing). 3. Tree indexing methods. 3This and the following chapter treat these three approaches in turn. Any of these approaches are potentially suitable for implementing the Dictionary ADT 3301 3302 3Chap. 9 Searching 3introduced in Section 4.4.

The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer.

This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory.

The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

REASON: The score is 0.83 because the first three nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, discussing 'binary search and interpolation search', 'implementing and comparing search algorithms', and 'comparing sequential and binary search', which are all pertinent to understanding search algorithms. However, the fourth node, which discusses 'a specific implementation detail of binary search with disk storage', and the fifth node, which provides 'an illustration of binary search', are not directly relevant to the expected learning outcomes and should be ranked lower. Additionally, the sixth node, which mentions 'implementing binary search and quadratic binary search', does not directly relate to the expected learning outcomes and should also be ranked lower.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle.

ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', 'Every time a record is inserted to or deleted from the database, all associated secondary indices must be updated. Updates to a linear index are expensive, be- cause the entire contents of the array might be shifted. Another problem is that multiple records with the same secondary key each duplicate that key value within the index. When the secondary key ﬁeld has many duplicates, such as when it has a limited range (e.g., a ﬁeld to indicate job category from among a small number of possible job categories), this duplication might waste considerable space.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'A drawback to this approach is that the array must be of ﬁxed size, which imposes an upper limit on the number of primary keys that might be associated with a particular secondary key. Furthermore, those secondary keys with fewer records than the width of the array will waste the remainder of their row. A better approach is to have a one-dimensional array of secondary key values, where each secondary key is associated with a linked list. This works well if the index is stored in main memory, but not so well when it is stored on disk because the linked list for a given key might be scattered across several disk blocks.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3Linear IndexDatabase Records42739852375298374273 3Figure 10.1 Linear indexing for variable-length records.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9285714285714286 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.93 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. For example, the first node discusses 'various indexing methods, including tree indexing and 2-3 trees,' which is relevant, while the seventh node, which is irrelevant, 'discusses sorting and organizing records using tree structures, but does not directly relate to the expected learning outcomes.' However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the eighth node that 'discusses the drawbacks of a fixed-size array for secondary keys,' are ranked higher than they should be.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record.

Updates to a linear index are expensive, be- cause the entire contents of the array might be shifted. Another problem is that multiple records with the same secondary key each duplicate that key value within the index. When the secondary key ﬁeld has many duplicates, such as when it has a limited range (e.g., a ﬁeld to indicate job category from among a small number of possible job categories), this duplication might waste considerable space.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key.

At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk.

Its main data structure is an array of linked lists, one linked list for each vertex.

A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces.', '11.2 An undirected graph need not explicitly store two separate directed edges to represent a single undirected edge. An alternative would be to store only a single undirected edge (I, J) to connect Vertices I and J. However, what if the user asks for edge (J, I)? We can solve this problem by consistently storing the edge such that the lesser of I and J always comes ﬁrst. Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we notice that only the lower triangle of the array is used.

For Dijkstra’s shortest paths algorithm, two different implementations were given in Sec- tion 11.4.1 that provide different ways for determining the next closest vertex at each iteration of the algorithm. The relative costs of these two variants depend on who sparse or dense the graph is. They might also depend on whether the graph is implemented using an adjacency list or adjacency ma- trix. Design and implement a study to compare the effects on performance for three variables: (i) the two graph representations (adjacency list and adja- cency matrix); (ii) the two implementations for Djikstra’s shortest paths alg- orithm (searching the table of vertex distances or using a priority queue to track the distances), and (iii) sparse versus dense graphs.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '// Copy the element 3listArray[i] = listArray[i+1]; 3listSize--; return it; 3// Decrement size 3} 3Figure 4.2 An array-based list implementation. 3Sec. 4.1 Lists 3public void moveToStart() { curr = 0; } // Set to front public void moveToEnd() { curr = listSize; } // Set at end public void prev() { if (curr != 0) curr--; } // Back up public void next() { if (curr < listSize) curr++; } 3/** @return List size */ public int length() { return listSize; }', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types.

REASON: The actual output covers some relevant topics like array-based list storage and efficiency, but lacks focus on advanced list structures, memory management, and fragmentation as expected.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '// Copy the element 3listArray[i] = listArray[i+1]; 3listSize--; return it; 3// Decrement size 3} 3Figure 4.2 An array-based list implementation. 3Sec. 4.1 Lists 3public void moveToStart() { curr = 0; } // Set to front public void moveToEnd() { curr = listSize; } // Set at end public void prev() { if (curr != 0) curr--; } // Back up public void next() { if (curr < listSize) curr++; } 3/** @return List size */ public int length() { return listSize; }', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2.

Similarly, the second node explains 'space efficiency and limitations of array-based lists versus linked lists,' which is relevant, whereas the sixth node, which is irrelevant, focuses on 'type safety in list implementations' and should be ranked lower.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '// Copy the element 3listArray[i] = listArray[i+1]; 3listSize--; return it; 3// Decrement size 3} 3Figure 4.2 An array-based list implementation. 3Sec. 4.1 Lists 3public void moveToStart() { curr = 0; } // Set to front public void moveToEnd() { curr = listSize; } // Set at end public void prev() { if (curr != 0) curr--; } // Back up public void next() { if (curr < listSize) curr++; } 3/** @return List size */ public int length() { return listSize; }', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list.

The relevant context can be found here: ['This chapter introduces several tree structures designed for use in specialized ap- plications. The trie of Section 13.1 is commonly used to store and retrieve strings. It also serves to illustrate the concept of a key space decomposition. The AVL tree and splay tree of Section 13.2 are variants on the BST. They are examples of self-balancing search trees and have guaranteed good performance regardless of the insertion order for records. An introduction to several spatial data structures used to organize point data by xy-coordinates is presented in Section 13.3.', 'We can solve these problems by selecting another tree structure that automat- ically remains balanced after updates, and which is amenable to storing in blocks. There are a number of balanced tree data structures, and there are also techniques for keeping BSTs balanced. Examples are the AVL and splay trees discussed in Section 13.2. As an alternative, Section 10.4 presents the 2-3 tree, which has the property that its leaves are always at the same level. The main reason for discussing the 2-3 tree here in preference to the other balanced search trees is that it naturally', 'way that retains the BST property. While Figure 13.7 is slightly different from Figure 13.5, in fact the splay tree single rotation is identical to the AVL tree single rotation. 3Unlike the AVL tree, the splay tree requires two types of double rotation.

Prior to the insert operation, all nodes of the tree are balanced (i.e., the depths of the left and right subtrees for every node differ by at most one). After inserting the node with value 5, the nodes with values 7 and 24 are no longer balanced. 313.2.1 The AVL Tree', 'Whenever a node S is accessed (e.g., when S is inserted, deleted, or is the goal of a search), the splay tree performs a process called splaying. Splaying moves S to the root of the BST. When S is being deleted, splaying moves the parent of S to the root. As in the AVL tree, a splay of node S consists of a series of rotations. A rotation moves S higher in the tree by adjusting its position with respect to its parent and grandparent. A side effect of the rotations is a tendency to balance the tree. There are three types of rotation.', '436 3Chap. 13 Advanced Tree Structures 3SXCXSBBCA(a)A(b) 3Figure 13.5 A single rotation in an AVL tree.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsFaithfulness ---> SCORE: 0.9 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly claims that 2-3 trees are balanced, while the retrieval context only states that 2-3 trees are not binary trees and does not address their balance.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9480519480519481 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.95 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first six nodes provide detailed information on tree structures and rotation methods, which are crucial for understanding advanced tree structures. However, the seventh node, which 'lists contents and sections without providing specific information relevant to the expected learning outcomes,' is ranked higher than some relevant nodes, slightly lowering the score.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Advanced Tree Structures. The relevant context can be found here: ['This chapter introduces several tree structures designed for use in specialized ap- plications. The trie of Section 13.1 is commonly used to store and retrieve strings. It also serves to illustrate the concept of a key space decomposition. The AVL tree and splay tree of Section 13.2 are variants on the BST. They are examples of self-balancing search trees and have guaranteed good performance regardless of the insertion order for records. An introduction to several spatial data structures used to organize point data by xy-coordinates is presented in Section 13.3.', 'We can solve these problems by selecting another tree structure that automat- ically remains balanced after updates, and which is amenable to storing in blocks. There are a number of balanced tree data structures, and there are also techniques for keeping BSTs balanced. Examples are the AVL and splay trees discussed in Section 13.2. As an alternative, Section 10.4 presents the 2-3 tree, which has the property that its leaves are always at the same level. The main reason for discussing the 2-3 tree here in preference to the other balanced search trees is that it naturally', 'way that retains the BST property. While Figure 13.7 is slightly different from Figure 13.5, in fact the splay tree single rotation is identical to the AVL tree single rotation. 3Unlike the AVL tree, the splay tree requires two types of double rotation. Dou- ble rotations involve S, its parent (call it P), and S’s grandparent (call it G). The effect of a double rotation is to move S up two levels in the tree. 3The ﬁrst double rotation is called a zigzag rotation. It takes place when either', 'Sec. 13.2 Balanced Trees 372324240120374224723242401203742245 3Figure 13.4 Example of an insert operation that violates the AVL tree balance property. Prior to the insert operation, all nodes of the tree are balanced (i.e., the depths of the left and right subtrees for every node differ by at most one). After inserting the node with value 5, the nodes with values 7 and 24 are no longer balanced. 313.2.1 The AVL Tree', 'Whenever a node S is accessed (e.g., when S is inserted, deleted, or is the goal of a search), the splay tree performs a process called splaying. Splaying moves S to the root of the BST. When S is being deleted, splaying moves the parent of S to the root. As in the AVL tree, a splay of node S consists of a series of rotations. A rotation moves S higher in the tree by adjusting its position with respect to its parent and grandparent. A side effect of the rotations is a tendency to balance the tree. There are three types of rotation.', '436 3Chap. 13 Advanced Tree Structures 3SXCXSBBCA(a)A(b) 3Figure 13.5 A single rotation in an AVL tree. This operation occurs when the excess node (in subtree A) is in the left child of the left child of the unbalanced node labeled S. By rearranging the nodes as shown, we preserve the BST property, as well as re-balance the tree to preserve the AVL tree balance property. The case where the excess node is in the right child of the right child of the unbalanced node is handled in the same way.', '405 3405 408 412 414 421 425 426 427 3429 3429 3Contents 313.2 Balanced Trees 313.2.1 The AVL Tree 13.2.2 The Splay Tree 13.3 Spatial Data Structures 13.3.1 The K-D Tree 13.3.2 The PR quadtree 13.3.3 Other Point Data Structures 13.3.4 Other Spatial Data Structures 313.4 Further Reading 13.5 Exercises 13.6 Projects 3V Theory of Algorithms 314 Analysis Techniques 314.1 Summation Techniques 14.2 Recurrence Relations', '300 into the AVL tree on the left in Figure 13.4. 3(c) Show the result (including appropriate rotations) of inserting the value 350 into the AVL tree on the left in Figure 13.4. 3(d) Show the result (including appropriate rotations) of inserting the value 31 into the AVL tree on the left in Figure 13.4. 313.6 Show the splay tree that results from searching for value 75 in the splay tree 3of Figure 13.10(d). 313.7 Show the splay tree that results from searching for value 18 in the splay tree', '455 3456 3Chap. 13 Advanced Tree Structures 3Implement the sufﬁx tree for a dictionary of words or phrases, with support for wildcard search. 313.3 Revise the BST class of Section 5.4 to use the AVL tree rotations.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lower Bounds. The relevant context can be found here: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lower Bounds. The relevant context can be found here: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem).

REASON: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lower Bounds. The relevant context can be found here: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds 3the concept of an adversarial lower bounds proof. Section 15.5 illustrates the con- cept of a state space lower bound. Section 15.6 presents a linear time worst-case algorithm for ﬁnding the ith biggest element on a list. Section 15.7 continues our discussion of sorting with a quest for the algorithm that requires the absolute fewest number of comparisons needed to sort a list. 315.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion.

For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds 3the concept of an adversarial lower bounds proof. Section 15.5 illustrates the con- cept of a state space lower bound. Section 15.6 presents a linear time worst-case algorithm for ﬁnding the ith biggest element on a list. Section 15.7 continues our discussion of sorting with a quest for the algorithm that requires the absolute fewest number of comparisons needed to sort a list. 315.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', 'Given this deﬁnition for searching, we can easily come up with the standard sequential search algorithm, and we can also see that the lower bound for this prob- lem is “obviously” n comparisons. (Keep in mind that the key K might not actually appear in the list.) However, lower bounds proofs are a bit slippery, and it is in- structive to see how they can go wrong. 3Theorem 15.1 The lower bound for the problem of searching in an unsorted list is n comparisons.', '1Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that any mention of bounds must specify what class of inputs are being considered. Do we mean the bound for the worst case input? The average cost over all inputs? Regardless of which class of inputs we consider, all of the issues raised apply equally. 3Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', 'Flyweight 3Strategy 31.4 Problems, Algorithms, and Programs 1.5 Further Reading 1.6 Exercises 32 Mathematical Preliminaries 2.1 Sets and Relations 2.2 Miscellaneous Notation 2.3 Logarithms 2.4 Summations and Recurrences 2.5 Recursion 2.6 Mathematical Proof Techniques 3xiii 31 33 4 4 6 8 12 13 13 14 15 16 18 20 323 23 27 29 30 34 36 3iii 3iv 32.6.1 Direct Proof 2.6.2 2.6.3 2.7 Estimation 2.8 Further Reading 2.9 Exercises 3Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', '[Man89] 3Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach. 3[MM04] 3[MM08] 3[P´ol57] 3[Pug90] W.

REASON: The score is 0.25 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'dynamic programming, randomized algorithms, and numerical algorithms', is ranked fourth. However, irrelevant nodes such as the first node, which 'focuses on analysis techniques and lower bounds', and the second node, which 'discusses solving recurrence relations and divide and conquer algorithms', are ranked higher.

Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', 'The theory of N P-completeness gives a technique for separating tractable from (probably) intractable problems. Recalling the algorithm for generating algorithms in Section 15.1, we can reﬁne it for problems that we suspect are N P-complete. When faced with a new problem, we might alternate between checking if it is tractable (that is, we try to ﬁnd a polynomial-time solution) and checking if it is intractable (we try to prove the problem is N P-complete).

Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt.

To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 1.0 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The relevant nodes provide detailed insights into topics such as 'Reductions', 'Hard Problems', and the 'Halting Problem', which are crucial for understanding the chapter on Limits to Computation. The irrelevant nodes, which discuss general programming concepts, mathematical preliminaries, and problem-solving strategies, are appropriately ranked lower as they do not directly relate to the chapter's learning outcomes. Great job on achieving perfect precision!

However, the sentence 'Demonstrate an understanding' is too vague and lacks direct attribution to any specific node, slightly lowering the score.

We could modify our compiler (or write 3Sec. 17.4 Further Reading', 'Not all problems requiring exponential time on a regular computer are in N P. For example, Towers of Hanoi is not in N P, because it must print out O(2n) moves for n disks. A non-deterministic machine cannot “guess” and print the correct answer in less time. 3On the other hand, consider the TRAVELING SALESMAN problem. 3TRAVELING SALESMAN (1) 3Input: A complete, directed graph G with positive distances assigned to 3each edge in the graph.', 'Turing machines are a simple model of computation for writing programs that are language acceptors. There is a “universal” Turing machine that can take as in- put a description for a Turing machine, and an input string, and return the execution of that machine on that string. This Turing machine in turn can be cast as a Boolean expression such that the expression is satisﬁable if and only if the Turing machine yields ACCEPT for that string. Cook used Turing machines in his proof because they are simple enough that he could develop this transformation of Turing ma- chines to Boolean expressions, but rich enough to be able to compute any function that a regular computer can compute. The signiﬁcance of this transformation is that any decision problem that is performable by the Turing machine is transformable to SAT. Thus, SAT is N P-hard.', 'Simplifying Rules 33.5 Calculating the Running Time for a Program 3.6 Analyzing Problems 3.7 Common Misunderstandings 3.8 Multiple Parameters 3.9 Space Bounds 3.10 Speeding Up Your Programs 3.11 Empirical Analysis 3.12 Further Reading 3.13 Exercises 3.14 Projects 3II Fundamental Data Structures 34 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists 34.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 4.1.2 Linked Lists 4.1.3 Comparison of List Implementations 3Contents 337 37 38 44 45 46', 'Flyweight 3Strategy 31.4 Problems, Algorithms, and Programs 1.5 Further Reading 1.6 Exercises 32 Mathematical Preliminaries 2.1 Sets and Relations 2.2 Miscellaneous Notation 2.3 Logarithms 2.4 Summations and Recurrences 2.5 Recursion 2.6 Mathematical Proof Techniques 3xiii 31 33 4 4 6 8 12 13 13 14 15 16 18 20 323 23 27 29 30 34 36 3iii 3iv 32.6.1 Direct Proof 2.6.2 2.6.3 2.7 Estimation 2.8 Further Reading 2.9 Exercises 3Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction', 'Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction 33 Algorithm Analysis 33.1 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 3.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm? 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 3Introduction 33.4.1 Upper Bounds 3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3.4.3 Θ Notation 3.4.4 3.4.5 Classifying Functions 3Simplifying Rules', 'Sec. 1.4 Problems, Algorithms, and Programs 3input from a physical process beyond the user’s control).
