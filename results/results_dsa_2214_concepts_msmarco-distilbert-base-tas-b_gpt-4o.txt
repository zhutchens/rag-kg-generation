This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues (Section 5.5) and for external sorting algorithms (Section 8.5.2).', 'Figure 5.1 illustrates the various terms used to identify parts of a binary tree.

A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

                Context: ['7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and fundamental tech- niques of algorithm analysis. We focus on a methodology known as asymptotic algorithm analysis, or simply asymptotic analysis. Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource consumption of an algorithm. It allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more algorithms for solving the same problem. Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource constraints for a problem before they imple- ment an actual program.

In other words, big-Oh notation states a claim about the greatest amount of some resource (usually time) that is required by an algorithm for some class of inputs of size n (typically the worst such input, the average of all possible inputs, or the best such input).', 'So far all of our examples of algorithm analysis give “obvious” results, with big-Oh always matching Ω. To understand how big-Oh, Ω, and Θ notations are properly used to describe our understanding of a problem or an algorithm, it is best to consider an example where you do not already know a lot about the problem.', 'Similar notation is used to describe the least amount of a resource that an alg- orithm needs for some class of input. Like big-Oh notation, this is a measure of the algorithm’s growth rate. Like big-Oh notation, it works for any resource, but we most often measure the least amount of time required. And again, like big-Oh no- tation, we are measuring the resource required for some particular class of inputs: the worst-, average-, or best-case input of size n.', '83 384 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.12 Further Reading', 'As you can see from this discussion, asymptotic bounds notation is not a law of nature.

Throughout this book, Θ notation will be used in preference to big-Oh notation whenever our state of knowledge makes that possible.

REASON: The score is 0.97 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms' and 'asymptotic complexity analysis', which are relevant to the expected output. However, the tenth node, which only mentions 'Further Reading' and does not provide relevant information, is ranked lower. Similarly, the thirteenth node, which is a list of unrelated terms, is also ranked lower. This demonstrates that the system effectively prioritized relevant information, but the presence of these irrelevant nodes slightly lowered the score from a perfect 1.0.

REASON: The score is 0.70 because several key concepts like 'Asymptotic Analysis', 'Big O notation', 'Algorithm Growth Rates', 'Upper Bounds', 'Lower Bounds', 'Empirical Analysis', and 'Factors of Algorithm Running Time' are supported by nodes in the retrieval context. However, the absence of explicit mentions of 'Space Bounds', 'Comparison of Algorithm Running Times', and 'Basic Operations' in the nodes affects the score.

                Context: ['7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and fundamental tech- niques of algorithm analysis. We focus on a methodology known as asymptotic algorithm analysis, or simply asymptotic analysis. Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource consumption of an algorithm. It allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more algorithms for solving the same problem. Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource constraints for a problem before they imple- ment an actual program.

In other words, big-Oh notation states a claim about the greatest amount of some resource (usually time) that is required by an algorithm for some class of inputs of size n (typically the worst such input, the average of all possible inputs, or the best such input).', 'So far all of our examples of algorithm analysis give “obvious” results, with big-Oh always matching Ω. To understand how big-Oh, Ω, and Θ notations are properly used to describe our understanding of a problem or an algorithm, it is best to consider an example where you do not already know a lot about the problem.', 'Similar notation is used to describe the least amount of a resource that an alg- orithm needs for some class of input. Like big-Oh notation, this is a measure of the algorithm’s growth rate. Like big-Oh notation, it works for any resource, but we most often measure the least amount of time required. And again, like big-Oh no- tation, we are measuring the resource required for some particular class of inputs: the worst-, average-, or best-case input of size n.', '83 384 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.12 Further Reading', 'As you can see from this discussion, asymptotic bounds notation is not a law of nature.

Note that we drop the word “in” for Θ notation, because there is a strict equality for two equations with the same Θ. In other words, if f (n) is Θ(g(n)), then g(n) is Θ(f (n)). 3Because the sequential search algorithm is both in O(n) and in Ω(n) in the', 'While some textbooks and programmers will casually say that an algorithm is “order of” or “big-Oh” of some cost function, it is generally better to use Θ notation rather than big-Oh notation whenever we have sufﬁcient knowledge about an alg- orithm to be sure that the upper and lower bounds indeed match. Throughout this book, Θ notation will be used in preference to big-Oh notation whenever our state of knowledge makes that possible. Limitations on our ability to analyze certain algorithms may require use of big-Oh or Ω notations.

                Context: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT.

Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses.

But if we wish to insert an element at the head of the list, all elements currently in the list must shift one position toward the tail to make room, as illustrated by Figure 4.3. This process takes Θ(n) time if there are n elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position i within a list of n elements, then n − i elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap. To remove the element at position i, n − i − 1 elements must shift toward the head.

To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

                Context: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements.

Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses.

Inserting or removing elements at the tail of the list is easy, so the append operation takes Θ(1) time. But if we wish to insert an element at the head of the list, all elements currently in the list must shift one position toward the tail to make room, as illustrated by Figure 4.3. This process takes Θ(n) time if there are n elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position i within a list of n elements, then n − i elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap. To remove the element at position i, n − i − 1 elements must shift toward the head. In the average case, insertion or removal requires moving half of the elements, which is Θ(n).', 'Sec. 4.3 Queues 3/** Queue ADT */ public interface Queue<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the queue. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the queue elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Place an element at the rear of the queue. 3@param it The element being enqueued. */ 3public void enqueue(E it); 3/** Remove and return element at the front of the queue. @return The element at the front of the queue. */ 3public E dequeue();', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2.

Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list.

Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists, Stacks, and Queues. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements.

Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer.

Inserting or removing elements at the tail of the list is easy, so the append operation takes Θ(1) time. But if we wish to insert an element at the head of the list, all elements currently in the list must shift one position toward the tail to make room, as illustrated by Figure 4.3. This process takes Θ(n) time if there are n elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position i within a list of n elements, then n − i elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap. To remove the element at position i, n − i − 1 elements must shift toward the head. In the average case, insertion or removal requires moving half of the elements, which is Θ(n).', 'Sec. 4.3 Queues 3/** Queue ADT */ public interface Queue<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the queue. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the queue elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Place an element at the rear of the queue. 3@param it The element being enqueued. */ 3public void enqueue(E it); 3/** Remove and return element at the front of the queue. @return The element at the front of the queue. */ 3public E dequeue();', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons. Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'public E dequeue(); 3/** @return The front element. */ public E frontValue(); 3/** @return The number of elements in the queue. */ public int length(); 3} 3Figure 4.24 The Java ADT for a queue. 3Recursive algorithms lend themselves to efﬁcient implementation with a stack when the amount of information needed to describe a sub-problem is small.

The only data member is top, a pointer to the ﬁrst (top) link node of the stack. Method push ﬁrst modiﬁes the next ﬁeld of the newly created link node to point to the top of the stack and then sets top to point to the new link node. Method pop is also quite simple. Variable temp stores the top nodes’ value, while ltemp links to the top node as it is removed from the stack. The stack is updated by setting top to point to the next link in the stack. The old top node is then returned to free store (or the freelist), and the element value is returned.', 'In the most general sense, a data structure is any data representation and its associated operations. Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', '(a) L1.append(10); L1.append(20); L1.append(15); 3Sec. 4.6 Exercises 3(b) L2.append(10); L2.append(20); L2.append(15); L2.moveToStart(); L2.insert(39); L2.next(); L2.insert(12); 34.3 Write a series of Java statements that uses the List ADT of Figure 4.1 to create a list capable of holding twenty elements and which actually stores the list with the following conﬁguration: 3(cid:104) 2, 23 | 15, 5, 9 (cid:105). 34.4 Using the list ADT of Figure 4.1, write a function to interchange the current', 'T(n) = T((cid:100)n/2(cid:101)) + T((cid:98)n/2(cid:99)) + n; T(1) = 1. 3Then, rewrite your algorithm to simulate the recursive calls with a stack. 4.18 Let Q be a non-empty queue, and let S be an empty stack.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers.

However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap. To remove the element at position i, n − i − 1 elements must shift toward the head. In the average case, insertion or removal requires moving half of the elements, which is Θ(n).', 'Sec. 4.3 Queues 3/** Queue ADT */ public interface Queue<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the queue. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the queue elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Place an element at the rear of the queue. 3@param it The element being enqueued. */ 3public void enqueue(E it); 3/** Remove and return element at the front of the queue. @return The element at the front of the queue. */ 3public E dequeue();', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2.

However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it.

                Context: ['Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Bubble Sort consists of a simple double for loop. The ﬁrst iteration of the inner for loop moves through the record array from bottom to top, comparing adjacent keys.

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array.

The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort.

After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

Show the appropriate summation.', 'Counting comparisons or swaps yields similar results. Each time through the inner for loop yields both a comparison and a swap, except the last (i.e., the comparison that fails the inner for loop’s test), which has no swap.

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure.

Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)).

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition.

Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

Show the appropriate summation.', 'Counting comparisons or swaps yields similar results. Each time through the inner for loop yields both a comparison and a swap, except the last (i.e., the comparison that fails the inner for loop’s test), which has no swap. Thus, the number of swaps for the entire sort operation is n − 1 less than the number of comparisons. This is 0 in the best case, and Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases. 37.2.2 Bubble Sort', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass.

Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements.

As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort.

This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2).

If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case.

When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is.

For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2).

To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass.

Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements.

As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2).

However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order.

After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

Show the appropriate summation.', 'Counting comparisons or swaps yields similar results. Each time through the inner for loop yields both a comparison and a swap, except the last (i.e., the comparison that fails the inner for loop’s test), which has no swap.

This is 0 in the best case, and Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases. 37.2.2 Bubble Sort', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

REASON: The score is 0.47 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the second node, which is irrelevant as it provides a technical description of Bubble Sort's implementation, is ranked higher than the fourth node, which is relevant as it mentions Insertion Sort, a key concept in the expected output. Similarly, the third node, which discusses the complexity of sorting algorithms in general terms without mentioning specific algorithms, is ranked higher than the sixth node, which is relevant as it mentions Shellsort, Quicksort, and Mergesort, all part of the expected output. However, the score is not lower because there are several relevant nodes, such as the first node discussing Bubble Sort and the tenth node discussing Quicksort and Insertion Sort, that are correctly ranked higher than some irrelevant nodes.

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements.

As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2).

However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort.

After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'what is the probability of its value being 0? 3(b) What is the average number of “1” bits for an n-bit random number?

Show the appropriate summation.', 'Counting comparisons or swaps yields similar results. Each time through the inner for loop yields both a comparison and a swap, except the last (i.e., the comparison that fails the inner for loop’s test), which has no swap. Thus, the number of swaps for the entire sort operation is n − 1 less than the number of comparisons. This is 0 in the best case, and Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases. 37.2.2 Bubble Sort', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass.

                Context: ['Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Bubble Sort consists of a simple double for loop.

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array. If the pivot values are selected at random, then this is extremely unlikely to happen.

The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases. The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', '7.3 The Bubble Sort implementation has the following inner for loop: 3for (int j=n-1; j>i; j--) 3Consider the effect of replacing this with the following statement: 3for (int j=n-1; j>0; j--) 3Would the new implementation work correctly? Would the change affect the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm? How would the change affect the running time of the algorithm?', '8.5.1 Simple Approaches to External Sorting', 'that can handle n airplanes quickly enough most of the time, but which fails to perform quickly enough when all n airplanes are coming from the same direction. For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'what is the probability of its value being 0? 3(b) What is the average number of “1” bits for an n-bit random number? (c) What is the expected value for the position of the leftmost “1” bit? In other words, how many positions on average must we examine when moving from left to right before encountering a “1” bit? Show the appropriate summation.', 'Counting comparisons or swaps yields similar results. Each time through the inner for loop yields both a comparison and a swap, except the last (i.e., the comparison that fails the inner for loop’s test), which has no swap. Thus, the number of swaps for the entire sort operation is n − 1 less than the number of comparisons. This is 0 in the best case, and Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases. 37.2.2 Bubble Sort', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost? Explain why or why not. 33.23 Prove that if an algorithm is Θ(f (n)) in the average case, then it is Ω(f (n)) 3in the worst case. 3Sec. 3.14 Projects 33.24 Prove that if an algorithm is Θ(f (n)) in the average case, then it is O(f (n)) 3in the best case. 33.14 Projects', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort.

But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', '15.18 Write the complete algorithm for the merge insert sort sketched out in Sec- 3tion 15.7. 315.19 Here is a suggestion for what might be a truly optimal sorting algorithm. Pick the best set of comparisons for input lists of size 2. Then pick the best set of comparisons for size 3, size 4, size 5, and so on. Combine them together into one program with a big case statement. Is this an algorithm? 3Sec. 15.10 Projects 315.10 Projects', 'How big a ﬁle can be merged in one pass? Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm. Otherwise, we often desire an average-case analysis if we know enough about the distribution of our input to compute the average case. If not, then we must resort to worst-case analysis. 33.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm?', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved.

Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases.

REASON: The score is 0.86 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'internal sort' and 'Merge-sort', which are relevant to 'External Sorts' and 'Replacement Selection'. However, the fifth node, which is too vague and does not mention any specific concepts from the expected output, is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. Additionally, the sixth node about 'snow' and 'Snowplow Movement' is irrelevant to file processing and external sorting, yet it appears before some relevant nodes.

Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', '7.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents 3195 3196 3197 3199 3206 3206 3206 3207 3210 3210 3212 3215 3215 3218 3221 3223 3224 3225 3225 3227 3229 3230 3231 3233 3236 3243 3244 3251 3253 3257 3257 3261 3Contents 38 File Processing and External Sorting 8.1 Primary versus Secondary Storage 8.2 Disk Drives 38.2.1 Disk Drive Architecture 8.2.2 Disk Access Costs 38.3 Buffers and Buffer Pools 8.4 The Programmer’s View of Files 8.5 External Sorting', '289 3290 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting', '279 3280 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting', '281 3282 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting', '275 3276 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting', '8.5.1 Simple Approaches to External Sorting']

One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost.

Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', 'Every time a record is inserted to or deleted from the database, all associated secondary indices must be updated. Updates to a linear index are expensive, be- cause the entire contents of the array might be shifted. Another problem is that multiple records with the same secondary key each duplicate that key value within the index. When the secondary key ﬁeld has many duplicates, such as when it has a limited range (e.g., a ﬁeld to indicate job category from among a small number of possible job categories), this duplication might waste considerable space.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3JonesSmithZukowskiAA10AX33ZQ99AB12AX35AB39ZX45FF37 3Figure 10.3 A two-dimensional linear index.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', 'Every time a record is inserted to or deleted from the database, all associated secondary indices must be updated. Updates to a linear index are expensive, be- cause the entire contents of the array might be shifted. Another problem is that multiple records with the same secondary key each duplicate that key value within the index. When the secondary key ﬁeld has many duplicates, such as when it has a limited range (e.g., a ﬁeld to indicate job category from among a small number of possible job categories), this duplication might waste considerable space.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them.

Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs.

Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never.

Updates to a linear index are expensive, be- cause the entire contents of the array might be shifted. Another problem is that multiple records with the same secondary key each duplicate that key value within the index. When the secondary key ﬁeld has many duplicates, such as when it has a limited range (e.g., a ﬁeld to indicate job category from among a small number of possible job categories), this duplication might waste considerable space.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key.

At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk.

                Context: ['A graph with edges directed from one vertex to another (as in Figure 11.1(b)) is called a directed graph or digraph. A graph whose edges are not directed is called an undirected graph (as illustrated by Figure 11.1(a)). A graph with labels associated with its vertices (as in Figure 11.1(c)) is called a labeled graph. Two vertices are adjacent if they are joined by an edge. Such vertices are also called neighbors. An edge connecting Vertices U and V is written (U, V). Such an edge is said to be incident on Vertices U and V. Associated with each edge may be a cost or weight. Graphs whose edges have weights (as in Figure 11.1(c)) are said to be weighted.', 'An undirected graph is connected if there is at least one path from any vertex to any other. The maximally connected subgraphs of an undirected graph are called connected components. For example, Figure 11.2 shows an undirected graph with three connected components. 3A graph without cycles is called acyclic. Thus, a directed graph without cycles 3is called a directed acyclic graph or DAG. 3A free tree is a connected, undirected graph with no simple cycles.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', 'A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data type and its physical implementation in a computer program. For example, there are two tra- ditional implementations for the list data type: the linked list and the array-based list. The list data type can therefore be implemented using a linked list or an ar- ray. Even the term “array” is ambiguous in that it can refer either to a data type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each memory location stores one ﬁxed-length data item. By this meaning, an array is a physical data structure. However, array can also mean a logical data type composed of a (typically ho- mogeneous) collection of data items, with each data item identiﬁed by an index It is possible to implement arrays in many different ways.

There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list.

REASON: The score is 0.00 because all nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant to the input. The first node discusses 'the storage and access of list elements in an array', which does not mention any of the expected output concepts like 'Multilists' or 'Memory Management'. The second node focuses on 'the comparison between array-based lists and linked lists', which does not cover the specific concepts listed in the expected output. The third node is about 'insertion and search efficiency in unsorted and sorted lists', which does not relate to the expected output concepts. All subsequent nodes similarly fail to address the expected output concepts, leading to a score of 0.00.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', 'A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data type and its physical implementation in a computer program. For example, there are two tra- ditional implementations for the list data type: the linked list and the array-based list. The list data type can therefore be implemented using a linked list or an ar- ray. Even the term “array” is ambiguous in that it can refer either to a data type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each memory location stores one ﬁxed-length data item. By this meaning, an array is a physical data structure. However, array can also mean a logical data type composed of a (typically ho- mogeneous) collection of data items, with each data item identiﬁed by an index It is possible to implement arrays in many different ways. For exam- number.', 'We can take advantage of this fact to save space. Instead of storing n(n + 1)/2 pieces of information in an n × n array, it would save space to use a list of length n(n + 1)/2. This is only practical if some means can be found to locate within the list the element that would correspond to position [r, c] in the original matrix.', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons.

They are the k-d tree and the PR quadtree. The k-d tree is a natural extension of the BST to multiple dimensions. It is a binary tree whose split- ting decisions alternate among the key dimensions. Like the BST, the k-d tree uses object space decomposition. The PR quadtree uses key space decomposition and so is a form of trie. It is a binary tree only for one-dimensional keys (in which case it is a trie with a binary alphabet). For d dimensions it has 2d branches. Thus, in two dimensions, the PR quadtree has four branches (hence the name “quadtree”), split- ting space into four equal-sized quadrants at each branch. Section 13.3.3 brieﬂy mentions two other variations on these data structures, the bintree and the point quadtree. These four structures cover all four combinations of object versus key space decomposition on the one hand, and multi-level binary versus 2d-way branch- ing on the other. Section 13.3.4 brieﬂy discusses spatial data structures for storing other types of spatial data.', 'The world of spatial data structures is rich and rapidly evolving. For a good introduction, see Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data Structures by Hanan Samet [Sam06]. This is also the best reference for more information on the PR quadtree. The k-d tree was invented by John Louis Bentley. For further information on the k-d tree, in addition to [Sam06], see [Ben75]. For information on using a quadtree to store arbitrary polygonal objects, see [SH92].', 'The differences between the k-d tree and the PR quadtree illustrate many of the design choices encountered when creating spatial data structures. The k-d tree pro- vides an object space decomposition of the region, while the PR quadtree provides a key space decomposition (thus, it is a trie). The k-d tree stores records at all nodes, while the PR quadtree stores records only at the leaf nodes. Finally, the two trees have different structures. The k-d tree is a binary tree (and need not be full), while the PR quadtree is a full tree with 2d branches (in the two-dimensional case, 22 = 4). Consider the extension of this concept to three dimensions. A k-d tree for three dimensions would alternate the discriminator through the x, y, and z dimen- sions. The three-dimensional equivalent of the PR quadtree would be a tree with 23 or eight branches. Such a tree is called an octree.']

The trie of Section 13.1 is commonly used to store and retrieve strings. It also serves to illustrate the concept of a key space decomposition. The AVL tree and splay tree of Section 13.2 are variants on the BST. They are examples of self-balancing search trees and have guaranteed good performance regardless of the insertion order for records. An introduction to several spatial data structures used to organize point data by xy-coordinates is presented in Section 13.3.', 'We can solve these problems by selecting another tree structure that automat- ically remains balanced after updates, and which is amenable to storing in blocks. There are a number of balanced tree data structures, and there are also techniques for keeping BSTs balanced. Examples are the AVL and splay trees discussed in Section 13.2. As an alternative, Section 10.4 presents the 2-3 tree, which has the property that its leaves are always at the same level.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lower Bounds. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'This section presents one of the most important and most useful proofs in com- puter science: No sorting algorithm based on key comparisons can possibly be faster than Ω(n log n) in the worst case. This proof is important for three reasons. First, knowing that widely used sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal is re- assuring. In particular, it means that you need not bang your head against the wall searching for an O(n) sorting algorithm (or at least not one in any way based on key comparisons). Second, this proof is one of the few non-trivial lower-bounds proofs that we have for any problem; that is, this proof provides one of the relatively few instances where our lower bound is tighter than simply measuring the size of the input and output. As such, it provides a useful model for proving lower bounds on other problems. Finally, knowing a lower bound for sorting gives us a lower bound in turn for other problems whose solution could be used as the basis for a sorting algorithm. The process of deriving asymptotic bounds for one problem from the asymptotic bounds of another is called a reduction, a concept further explored in Chapter 17.', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Theorem 15.1 The lower bound for the problem of searching in an unsorted list is n comparisons. 33Recalling the advice to be suspicious of any lower bounds proof that argues a given behavior “must” happen, this proof should be raising red ﬂags. However, in this particular case the problem is so constrained that there really is no (better) alternative to this particular sequence of events. 3Sec. 15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3Here is our ﬁrst attempt at proving the theorem.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', 'Given this deﬁnition for searching, we can easily come up with the standard sequential search algorithm, and we can also see that the lower bound for this prob- lem is “obviously” n comparisons. (Keep in mind that the key K might not actually appear in the list.) However, lower bounds proofs are a bit slippery, and it is in- structive to see how they can go wrong. 3Theorem 15.1 The lower bound for the problem of searching in an unsorted list is n comparisons.', 'A simple estimate for a problem’s lower bound can be obtained by measuring the size of the input that must be read and the output that must be written. Certainly no algorithm can be more efﬁcient than the problem’s I/O time. From this we see that the sorting problem cannot be solved by any algorithm in less than Ω(n) time because it takes at least n steps to read and write the n values to be sorted. Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order. So, based on our current knowledge of sorting algorithms and the size of the input, we know that the problem of sorting is bounded by Ω(n) and O(n log n).', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'Sec. 7.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 3performance for others. They also show that for some algorithms, the order of input has little effect.']

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'This section presents one of the most important and most useful proofs in com- puter science: No sorting algorithm based on key comparisons can possibly be faster than Ω(n log n) in the worst case. This proof is important for three reasons. First, knowing that widely used sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal is re- assuring. In particular, it means that you need not bang your head against the wall searching for an O(n) sorting algorithm (or at least not one in any way based on key comparisons). Second, this proof is one of the few non-trivial lower-bounds proofs that we have for any problem; that is, this proof provides one of the relatively few instances where our lower bound is tighter than simply measuring the size of the input and output.

This proof is important for three reasons. First, knowing that widely used sorting algorithms are asymptotically optimal is re- assuring. In particular, it means that you need not bang your head against the wall searching for an O(n) sorting algorithm (or at least not one in any way based on key comparisons). Second, this proof is one of the few non-trivial lower-bounds proofs that we have for any problem; that is, this proof provides one of the relatively few instances where our lower bound is tighter than simply measuring the size of the input and output. As such, it provides a useful model for proving lower bounds on other problems. Finally, knowing a lower bound for sorting gives us a lower bound in turn for other problems whose solution could be used as the basis for a sorting algorithm. The process of deriving asymptotic bounds for one problem from the asymptotic bounds of another is called a reduction, a concept further explored in Chapter 17.', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem.

However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem).

Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.3333333333333333 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.33 because the third node in the retrieval context correctly identifies key concepts such as 'Dynamic Programming', 'Randomized Algorithms', and 'Numerical Algorithms', which are relevant to the input. However, the first and second nodes, which are ranked higher, discuss 'sorting algorithms and divide-and-conquer strategies' and 'divide-and-conquer strategies' respectively, which are not directly related to the expected output focusing on dynamic programming and randomized algorithms. This misplacement of relevant and irrelevant nodes results in a lower score.

For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).
