                Context: ['4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list. The linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed. 3A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list. Because a list node is a distinct object (as opposed to simply a cell in an array), it is good practice to make a separate list node class. An additional beneﬁt to creating a', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Simplifying Rules 33.5 Calculating the Running Time for a Program 3.6 Analyzing Problems 3.7 Common Misunderstandings 3.8 Multiple Parameters 3.9 Space Bounds 3.10 Speeding Up Your Programs 3.11 Empirical Analysis 3.12 Further Reading 3.13 Exercises 3.14 Projects 3II Fundamental Data Structures 34 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists 34.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 4.1.2 Linked Lists 4.1.3 Comparison of List Implementations 3Contents 337 37 38 44 45 46', '107 3108 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3linked list.

BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices fur- ther away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom. Fig- ure 11.10 provides an implementation for the BFS algorithm. Figure 11.11 shows a graph and the corresponding breadth-ﬁrst search tree. Figure 11.12 illustrates the BFS process for the graph of Figure 11.11(a).', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsFaithfulness ---> SCORE: 0.9 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.90 because the actual output inaccurately states that 'List Node Class' is used to represent nodes in a linked list, while the retrieval context emphasizes the importance of creating a separate 'Link class' for this purpose.

                Context: ['4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list. The linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed. 3A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list. Because a list node is a distinct object (as opposed to simply a cell in an array), it is good practice to make a separate list node class. An additional beneﬁt to creating a', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Simplifying Rules 33.5 Calculating the Running Time for a Program 3.6 Analyzing Problems 3.7 Common Misunderstandings 3.8 Multiple Parameters 3.9 Space Bounds 3.10 Speeding Up Your Programs 3.11 Empirical Analysis 3.12 Further Reading 3.13 Exercises 3.14 Projects 3II Fundamental Data Structures 34 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists 34.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 4.1.2 Linked Lists 4.1.3 Comparison of List Implementations 3Contents 337 37 38 44 45 46', '107 3108 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3linked list.

Figure 11.12 illustrates the BFS process for the graph of Figure 11.11(a).', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.8287296916256193 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.83 because while the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher, there are some irrelevant nodes that disrupt the overall ranking. For instance, the third node (rank 3) does not provide specific learning concepts, which affects the score. However, the first two nodes (rank 1 and 2) are highly relevant, discussing linked lists and key algorithm concepts, contributing positively to the score.

                Context: ['4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list. The linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed. 3A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list. Because a list node is a distinct object (as opposed to simply a cell in an array), it is good practice to make a separate list node class. An additional beneﬁt to creating a', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Simplifying Rules 33.5 Calculating the Running Time for a Program 3.6 Analyzing Problems 3.7 Common Misunderstandings 3.8 Multiple Parameters 3.9 Space Bounds 3.10 Speeding Up Your Programs 3.11 Empirical Analysis 3.12 Further Reading 3.13 Exercises 3.14 Projects 3II Fundamental Data Structures 34 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists 34.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 4.1.2 Linked Lists 4.1.3 Comparison of List Implementations 3Contents 337 37 38 44 45 46', '107 3108 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3linked list. Requests for new nodes (after the list has shrunk) can be handled by the freelist. Another good opportunity to use a freelist occurs when a program uses multiple lists. So long as they do not all grow and shrink together, the free list can let link nodes move between the lists.', 'Figure 4.27 An array-based queue implementation. 3130 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Linked queue implementation */ class LQueue<E> implements Queue<E> { 3private Link<E> front; private Link<E> rear; private int size; 3// Pointer to front queue node // Pointer to rear queuenode // Number of elements in queue 3/** Constructors */ public LQueue() { init(); } public LQueue(int size) { init(); } // Ignore size 3/** Initialize queue */ private void init() {', '} 3/** @return Stack size */ public int length() { return top; } 3Figure 4.19 Array-based stack class implementation. 3120 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Linked stack implementation */ class LStack<E> implements Stack<E> { 3private Link<E> top; private int size; 3// Pointer to first element // Number of elements 3/** Constructors */ public LStack() { top = null; size = 0; } public LStack(int size) { top = null; size = 0; }', '93 394 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists', 'Our second graph traversal algorithm is known as a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS). BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices fur- ther away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom. Fig- ure 11.10 provides an implementation for the BFS algorithm. Figure 11.11 shows a graph and the corresponding breadth-ﬁrst search tree. Figure 11.12 illustrates the BFS process for the graph of Figure 11.11(a).', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'This chapter begins by presenting deﬁnitions and some key properties of bi- nary trees. Section 5.2 discusses how to process all nodes of the binary tree in an organized manner.

Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting 3While selecting the median in this way is guaranteed to eliminate a fraction of the elements (leaving at most (cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101) elements left), we still need to be sure that our recursion yields a linear-time algorithm. We model the algorithm by the following recurrence. 3T(n) ≤ T((cid:100)n/5(cid:101)) + T((cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101)) + 6(cid:100)n/5(cid:101) + n − 1.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians.

Explain why this is true. Hint: The Master Theorem (Theorem 14.1) might help you. 315.8 Show that any comparison-based algorithm for ﬁnding the median must use 3at least n − 1 comparisons.', '15.13 Given an undirected graph G, the problem is to determine whether or not G is connected.

To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', '2.1 Sets and Relations 3The concept of a set in the mathematical sense has wide application in computer science. The notations and techniques of set theory are commonly used when de- scribing and implementing algorithms because the abstractions associated with sets often help to clarify and simplify algorithm design.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions.

                Context: ['Choose the n/5 medians for groups of ﬁve elements from the list. Choosing the median of ﬁve items can be done in constant time. 3Recursively, select M, the median of the n/5 medians-of-ﬁves. • Partition the list into those elements larger and smaller than M. 3Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting', 'Notice, however, that if we choose any constant c, and then if we pick the median from a sample of size n/c, then we can guarantee that we will discard at least n/2c elements. Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting 3While selecting the median in this way is guaranteed to eliminate a fraction of the elements (leaving at most (cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101) elements left), we still need to be sure that our recursion yields a linear-time algorithm. We model the algorithm by the following recurrence. 3T(n) ≤ T((cid:100)n/5(cid:101)) + T((cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101)) + 6(cid:100)n/5(cid:101) + n − 1.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians. The median of ﬁve elements is guaran- teed to have at least two in each partition. The median of three medians from a collection of 15 elements is guaranteed to have at least ﬁve elements in each partition.', 'Sec. 15.10 Projects 315.10 Projects 315.1 Implement the median-ﬁnding algorithm of Section 15.6.

Explain why this is true. Hint: The Master Theorem (Theorem 14.1) might help you. 315.8 Show that any comparison-based algorithm for ﬁnding the median must use 3at least n − 1 comparisons.', '15.13 Given an undirected graph G, the problem is to determine whether or not G is connected. Use an adversary argument to prove that it is necessary to look at all (n2 − n)/2 potential edges in the worst case. 315.14 3(a) Write an equation that describes the average cost for ﬁnding the median. 3(b) Solve your equation from part (a). 315.15 3(a) Write an equation that describes the average cost for ﬁnding the ith- smallest value in an array. This will be a function of both n and i, T(n, i).', 'Is it possible to modify our algorithm to get worst-case linear time? To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', '2.1 Sets and Relations 3The concept of a set in the mathematical sense has wide application in computer science. The notations and techniques of set theory are commonly used when de- scribing and implementing algorithms because the abstractions associated with sets often help to clarify and simplify algorithm design.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list. Here is a simple algorithm for ﬁnding the largest value.', 'Sec. 7.12 Projects 37.18 Which of the following operations are best implemented by ﬁrst sorting the list of numbers?

The ﬁrst two equations are both linear; only the value of the constant factor has changed. In both cases, the machine that is ten times faster gives an increase in problem size by a factor of ten. In other words, while the value of the constant does affect the absolute size of the problem that can be solved in a ﬁxed amount of time, it does not affect the improvement in problem size (as a proportion to the original size) gained by a faster computer.

REASON: The actual output includes concepts like 'Median selection' and 'Recursion' which are relevant, but it fails to mention key concepts from the expected output such as 'Sets and Relations' and 'Set Notation'. The input context does not sufficiently support the actual output's focus on algorithmic concepts over foundational mathematical concepts.

                Context: ['Choose the n/5 medians for groups of ﬁve elements from the list. Choosing the median of ﬁve items can be done in constant time. 3Recursively, select M, the median of the n/5 medians-of-ﬁves. • Partition the list into those elements larger and smaller than M. 3Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting', 'Notice, however, that if we choose any constant c, and then if we pick the median from a sample of size n/c, then we can guarantee that we will discard at least n/2c elements. Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting 3While selecting the median in this way is guaranteed to eliminate a fraction of the elements (leaving at most (cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101) elements left), we still need to be sure that our recursion yields a linear-time algorithm. We model the algorithm by the following recurrence. 3T(n) ≤ T((cid:100)n/5(cid:101)) + T((cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101)) + 6(cid:100)n/5(cid:101) + n − 1.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians. The median of ﬁve elements is guaran- teed to have at least two in each partition. The median of three medians from a collection of 15 elements is guaranteed to have at least ﬁve elements in each partition.', 'Sec. 15.10 Projects 315.10 Projects 315.1 Implement the median-ﬁnding algorithm of Section 15.6.

Explain why this is true. Hint: The Master Theorem (Theorem 14.1) might help you. 315.8 Show that any comparison-based algorithm for ﬁnding the median must use 3at least n − 1 comparisons.', '15.13 Given an undirected graph G, the problem is to determine whether or not G is connected. Use an adversary argument to prove that it is necessary to look at all (n2 − n)/2 potential edges in the worst case. 315.14 3(a) Write an equation that describes the average cost for ﬁnding the median. 3(b) Solve your equation from part (a). 315.15 3(a) Write an equation that describes the average cost for ﬁnding the ith- smallest value in an array. This will be a function of both n and i, T(n, i).', 'Is it possible to modify our algorithm to get worst-case linear time? To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', '2.1 Sets and Relations 3The concept of a set in the mathematical sense has wide application in computer science. The notations and techniques of set theory are commonly used when de- scribing and implementing algorithms because the abstractions associated with sets often help to clarify and simplify algorithm design.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list. Here is a simple algorithm for ﬁnding the largest value.', 'Sec. 7.12 Projects 37.18 Which of the following operations are best implemented by ﬁrst sorting the list of numbers?

In this example, the ﬁrst disk block of the linear index stores keys in the range 1 to 2001, and the second disk block stores keys in the range 2003 to 5688. Thus, the ﬁrst entry of the second-level index is key value 1 (the ﬁrst key in the ﬁrst block of the linear index), while the second entry of the second-level index is key value 2003.', 'This table illustrates many important points. The ﬁrst two equations are both linear; only the value of the constant factor has changed. In both cases, the machine that is ten times faster gives an increase in problem size by a factor of ten. In other words, while the value of the constant does affect the absolute size of the problem that can be solved in a ﬁxed amount of time, it does not affect the improvement in problem size (as a proportion to the original size) gained by a faster computer.

Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting 3While selecting the median in this way is guaranteed to eliminate a fraction of the elements (leaving at most (cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101) elements left), we still need to be sure that our recursion yields a linear-time algorithm. We model the algorithm by the following recurrence. 3T(n) ≤ T((cid:100)n/5(cid:101)) + T((cid:100)(7n − 5)/10(cid:101)) + 6(cid:100)n/5(cid:101) + n − 1.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition.

Explain why this is true. Hint: The Master Theorem (Theorem 14.1) might help you. 315.8 Show that any comparison-based algorithm for ﬁnding the median must use 3at least n − 1 comparisons.', '15.13 Given an undirected graph G, the problem is to determine whether or not G is connected.

This will be a function of both n and i, T(n, i).', 'Is it possible to modify our algorithm to get worst-case linear time? To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', '2.1 Sets and Relations 3The concept of a set in the mathematical sense has wide application in computer science. The notations and techniques of set theory are commonly used when de- scribing and implementing algorithms because the abstractions associated with sets often help to clarify and simplify algorithm design.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list. Here is a simple algorithm for ﬁnding the largest value.', 'Sec. 7.12 Projects 37.18 Which of the following operations are best implemented by ﬁrst sorting the list of numbers?

In this example, the ﬁrst disk block of the linear index stores keys in the range 1 to 2001, and the second disk block stores keys in the range 2003 to 5688.

The ﬁrst two equations are both linear; only the value of the constant factor has changed. In both cases, the machine that is ten times faster gives an increase in problem size by a factor of ten. In other words, while the value of the constant does affect the absolute size of the problem that can be solved in a ﬁxed amount of time, it does not affect the improvement in problem size (as a proportion to the original size) gained by a faster computer.

REASON: The score is 0.93 because while the relevant nodes are predominantly ranked higher, there are some irrelevant nodes that appear in the middle of the ranking. Specifically, the fifth node discusses projects, which 'does not directly relate to the key concepts of mathematical preliminaries.' This lowers the score slightly, but the majority of the relevant nodes, such as the first node that 'discusses the process of selecting medians and partitioning lists,' are well-placed, contributing to a high score.

                Context: ['A strategy contrary to best ﬁt might make sense because it tends to minimize the effects of external fragmentation. This is called worst ﬁt, which always allocates the largest block on the list hoping that the remainder of the block will be useful for servicing a future request. In our example, the worst ﬁt is the block of size 45, leaving a remainder of size 15. If there are a few unusually large requests, this approach will have less chance of servicing them. If requests generally tend to be of the same size, then this might be an effective strategy. Like best ﬁt, worst ﬁt requires searching the entire freelist at each memory request to ﬁnd the largest block. Alternatively, the freelist can be ordered from largest to smallest free block, possibly by using a priority queue implementation.', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2).

As with Quicksort, we get bad performance if the pivot is the ﬁrst or last element in the array. This would lead to possibly O(n2) performance. However, if the pivot were to always cut the array in half, then our cost would be modeled by the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n or O(n) cost.', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'Chapter 7 presents sorting algorithms whose running time is in O(n log n) for the worst case. This greatly narrows the gap. With this new knowledge, we now have a lower bound in Ω(n) and an upper bound in O(n log n). Should we search 3Sec. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The running time for a recursive algorithm is most easily expressed by a recur- sive expression because the total time for the recursive algorithm includes the time to run the recursive call(s). A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself. A classic example is the recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function: 3n! = (n − 1)! · n for n > 1; 31! = 0! = 1.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'There are many comparison-based sorting algorithms, and each will be mod- eled by a different decision tree. Some decision trees might be well-balanced, oth- ers might be unbalanced. Some trees will have more nodes than others (those with more nodes might be making “unnecessary” comparisons). In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case. In other words, we would like to know what is the smallest depth possible for the deepest node in the tree for any sorting algorithm.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

Your implementation should support the following operations on the matrix:', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '(c) A third algorithm has time complexity T(n) = 8n.

We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)).

                Context: ['A strategy contrary to best ﬁt might make sense because it tends to minimize the effects of external fragmentation. This is called worst ﬁt, which always allocates the largest block on the list hoping that the remainder of the block will be useful for servicing a future request. In our example, the worst ﬁt is the block of size 45, leaving a remainder of size 15. If there are a few unusually large requests, this approach will have less chance of servicing them. If requests generally tend to be of the same size, then this might be an effective strategy. Like best ﬁt, worst ﬁt requires searching the entire freelist at each memory request to ﬁnd the largest block. Alternatively, the freelist can be ordered from largest to smallest free block, possibly by using a priority queue implementation.', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system.

What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2).

As with Quicksort, we get bad performance if the pivot is the ﬁrst or last element in the array. This would lead to possibly O(n2) performance. However, if the pivot were to always cut the array in half, then our cost would be modeled by the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n or O(n) cost.', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'Chapter 7 presents sorting algorithms whose running time is in O(n log n) for the worst case. This greatly narrows the gap. With this new knowledge, we now have a lower bound in Ω(n) and an upper bound in O(n log n). Should we search 3Sec. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The running time for a recursive algorithm is most easily expressed by a recur- sive expression because the total time for the recursive algorithm includes the time to run the recursive call(s). A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself. A classic example is the recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function: 3n! = (n − 1)! · n for n > 1; 31! = 0! = 1.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'There are many comparison-based sorting algorithms, and each will be mod- eled by a different decision tree. Some decision trees might be well-balanced, oth- ers might be unbalanced. Some trees will have more nodes than others (those with more nodes might be making “unnecessary” comparisons). In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case. In other words, we would like to know what is the smallest depth possible for the deepest node in the tree for any sorting algorithm.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '(c) A third algorithm has time complexity T(n) = 8n.

                Context: ['A strategy contrary to best ﬁt might make sense because it tends to minimize the effects of external fragmentation. This is called worst ﬁt, which always allocates the largest block on the list hoping that the remainder of the block will be useful for servicing a future request. In our example, the worst ﬁt is the block of size 45, leaving a remainder of size 15. If there are a few unusually large requests, this approach will have less chance of servicing them. If requests generally tend to be of the same size, then this might be an effective strategy. Like best ﬁt, worst ﬁt requires searching the entire freelist at each memory request to ﬁnd the largest block. Alternatively, the freelist can be ordered from largest to smallest free block, possibly by using a priority queue implementation.', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2).

As with Quicksort, we get bad performance if the pivot is the ﬁrst or last element in the array. This would lead to possibly O(n2) performance. However, if the pivot were to always cut the array in half, then our cost would be modeled by the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n or O(n) cost.', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'Chapter 7 presents sorting algorithms whose running time is in O(n log n) for the worst case. This greatly narrows the gap. With this new knowledge, we now have a lower bound in Ω(n) and an upper bound in O(n log n). Should we search 3Sec. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The running time for a recursive algorithm is most easily expressed by a recur- sive expression because the total time for the recursive algorithm includes the time to run the recursive call(s). A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself. A classic example is the recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function: 3n! = (n − 1)! · n for n > 1; 31! = 0! = 1.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'There are many comparison-based sorting algorithms, and each will be mod- eled by a different decision tree. Some decision trees might be well-balanced, oth- ers might be unbalanced. Some trees will have more nodes than others (those with more nodes might be making “unnecessary” comparisons). In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case. In other words, we would like to know what is the smallest depth possible for the deepest node in the tree for any sorting algorithm.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '(c) A third algorithm has time complexity T(n) = 8n.

                Context: ['A strategy contrary to best ﬁt might make sense because it tends to minimize the effects of external fragmentation. This is called worst ﬁt, which always allocates the largest block on the list hoping that the remainder of the block will be useful for servicing a future request. In our example, the worst ﬁt is the block of size 45, leaving a remainder of size 15. If there are a few unusually large requests, this approach will have less chance of servicing them. If requests generally tend to be of the same size, then this might be an effective strategy. Like best ﬁt, worst ﬁt requires searching the entire freelist at each memory request to ﬁnd the largest block. Alternatively, the freelist can be ordered from largest to smallest free block, possibly by using a priority queue implementation.', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array.

As with Quicksort, we get bad performance if the pivot is the ﬁrst or last element in the array. This would lead to possibly O(n2) performance. However, if the pivot were to always cut the array in half, then our cost would be modeled by the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n or O(n) cost.', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'Chapter 7 presents sorting algorithms whose running time is in O(n log n) for the worst case. This greatly narrows the gap. With this new knowledge, we now have a lower bound in Ω(n) and an upper bound in O(n log n). Should we search 3Sec. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The running time for a recursive algorithm is most easily expressed by a recur- sive expression because the total time for the recursive algorithm includes the time to run the recursive call(s). A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself. A classic example is the recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function: 3n! = (n − 1)! · n for n > 1; 31! = 0! = 1.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'There are many comparison-based sorting algorithms, and each will be mod- eled by a different decision tree. Some decision trees might be well-balanced, oth- ers might be unbalanced. Some trees will have more nodes than others (those with more nodes might be making “unnecessary” comparisons). In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case. In other words, we would like to know what is the smallest depth possible for the deepest node in the tree for any sorting algorithm.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

Your implementation should support the following operations on the matrix:', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '(c) A third algorithm has time complexity T(n) = 8n.

We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)).

REASON: The score is 0.93 because while the relevant nodes are predominantly ranked higher, there are a few irrelevant nodes that appear among the top ranks. For instance, the fifth node discusses a question about Quicksort, which does not contribute to the learning concepts, thus affecting the overall ranking. However, the majority of the relevant nodes, such as the first and second nodes, provide critical insights into worst-case analysis and memory allocation strategies, which are essential for understanding algorithm performance.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Algorithm Analysis. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['A strategy contrary to best ﬁt might make sense because it tends to minimize the effects of external fragmentation. This is called worst ﬁt, which always allocates the largest block on the list hoping that the remainder of the block will be useful for servicing a future request. In our example, the worst ﬁt is the block of size 45, leaving a remainder of size 15. If there are a few unusually large requests, this approach will have less chance of servicing them. If requests generally tend to be of the same size, then this might be an effective strategy. Like best ﬁt, worst ﬁt requires searching the entire freelist at each memory request to ﬁnd the largest block. Alternatively, the freelist can be ordered from largest to smallest free block, possibly by using a priority queue implementation.', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array.

As with Quicksort, we get bad performance if the pivot is the ﬁrst or last element in the array. This would lead to possibly O(n2) performance. However, if the pivot were to always cut the array in half, then our cost would be modeled by the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n or O(n) cost.', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'Chapter 7 presents sorting algorithms whose running time is in O(n log n) for the worst case. This greatly narrows the gap. With this new knowledge, we now have a lower bound in Ω(n) and an upper bound in O(n log n). Should we search 3Sec. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The running time for a recursive algorithm is most easily expressed by a recur- sive expression because the total time for the recursive algorithm includes the time to run the recursive call(s). A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself. A classic example is the recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function: 3n! = (n − 1)! · n for n > 1; 31! = 0! = 1.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'There are many comparison-based sorting algorithms, and each will be mod- eled by a different decision tree. Some decision trees might be well-balanced, oth- ers might be unbalanced. Some trees will have more nodes than others (those with more nodes might be making “unnecessary” comparisons). In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case. In other words, we would like to know what is the smallest depth possible for the deepest node in the tree for any sorting algorithm.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

Your implementation should support the following operations on the matrix:', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '(c) A third algorithm has time complexity T(n) = 8n.

Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)).

These are all examples of polynomial running time, because the exponents for all terms of these equations are constants.

                Context: ['A strategy contrary to best ﬁt might make sense because it tends to minimize the effects of external fragmentation. This is called worst ﬁt, which always allocates the largest block on the list hoping that the remainder of the block will be useful for servicing a future request. In our example, the worst ﬁt is the block of size 45, leaving a remainder of size 15. If there are a few unusually large requests, this approach will have less chance of servicing them. If requests generally tend to be of the same size, then this might be an effective strategy. Like best ﬁt, worst ﬁt requires searching the entire freelist at each memory request to ﬁnd the largest block. Alternatively, the freelist can be ordered from largest to smallest free block, possibly by using a priority queue implementation.', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array.

As with Quicksort, we get bad performance if the pivot is the ﬁrst or last element in the array. This would lead to possibly O(n2) performance. However, if the pivot were to always cut the array in half, then our cost would be modeled by the recurrence T(n) = T(n/2) + n = 2n or O(n) cost.', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'Chapter 7 presents sorting algorithms whose running time is in O(n log n) for the worst case. This greatly narrows the gap. With this new knowledge, we now have a lower bound in Ω(n) and an upper bound in O(n log n). Should we search 3Sec. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The running time for a recursive algorithm is most easily expressed by a recur- sive expression because the total time for the recursive algorithm includes the time to run the recursive call(s). A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself. A classic example is the recursive deﬁnition for the factorial function: 3n! = (n − 1)! · n for n > 1; 31! = 0! = 1.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'There are many comparison-based sorting algorithms, and each will be mod- eled by a different decision tree. Some decision trees might be well-balanced, oth- ers might be unbalanced. Some trees will have more nodes than others (those with more nodes might be making “unnecessary” comparisons). In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case. In other words, we would like to know what is the smallest depth possible for the deepest node in the tree for any sorting algorithm.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

Your implementation should support the following operations on the matrix:', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '(c) A third algorithm has time complexity T(n) = 8n.

Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)).

These are all examples of polynomial running time, because the exponents for all terms of these equations are constants.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists, Stacks, and Queues. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', '4.6 Modify the code of Figure 4.19 to support storing variable-length strings of at most 255 characters. The stack array should have type char. A string is represented by a series of characters (one character per stack element), with the length of the string stored in the stack element immediately above the string itself, as illustrated by Figure 4.34. The push operation would store an element requiring i storage units in the i positions beginning with the current value of top and store the size in the position i storage units above top. The value of top would then be reset above the newly inserted element. The pop operation need only look at the size value stored in position top − 1 and then pop off the appropriate number of units. You may store the string on the stack in reverse order if you prefer, provided that when it is popped from the stack, it is returned in its proper order.', 'For the implementation of Figure 4.19, top is deﬁned to be the array index of the ﬁrst free position in the stack. Thus, an empty stack has top set to 0, the ﬁrst available free position in the array. (Alternatively, top could have been deﬁned to be the index for the top element in the stack, rather than the ﬁrst free position. If this had been done, the empty list would initialize top as −1.) Methods push and pop simply place an element into, or remove an element from, the array position indicated by top. Because top is assumed to be at the ﬁrst free position, push ﬁrst inserts its value into the top position and then increments top, while pop ﬁrst decrements top and then removes the top element.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists, Stacks, and Queues. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', '4.6 Modify the code of Figure 4.19 to support storing variable-length strings of at most 255 characters. The stack array should have type char. A string is represented by a series of characters (one character per stack element), with the length of the string stored in the stack element immediately above the string itself, as illustrated by Figure 4.34. The push operation would store an element requiring i storage units in the i positions beginning with the current value of top and store the size in the position i storage units above top. The value of top would then be reset above the newly inserted element. The pop operation need only look at the size value stored in position top − 1 and then pop off the appropriate number of units. You may store the string on the stack in reverse order if you prefer, provided that when it is popped from the stack, it is returned in its proper order.', 'For the implementation of Figure 4.19, top is deﬁned to be the array index of the ﬁrst free position in the stack. Thus, an empty stack has top set to 0, the ﬁrst available free position in the array. (Alternatively, top could have been deﬁned to be the index for the top element in the stack, rather than the ﬁrst free position. If this had been done, the empty list would initialize top as −1.) Methods push and pop simply place an element into, or remove an element from, the array position indicated by top. Because top is assumed to be at the ﬁrst free position, push ﬁrst inserts its value into the top position and then increments top, while pop ﬁrst decrements top and then removes the top element.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', '// Create listArray 3} 3/** Reinitialize stack */ public void clear() { top = 0; } 3/** Push "it" onto stack */ public void push(E it) { 3assert top != maxSize : "Stack is full"; listArray[top++] = it; 3} 3/** Remove and top element */ public E pop() { 3assert top != 0 : "Stack is empty"; return listArray[--top]; 3} 3/** @return Top element */ public E topValue() { 3assert top != 0 : "Stack is empty"; return listArray[top-1]; 3} 3/** @return Stack size */ public int length() { return top; }', 'Sec. 4.2 Stacks 3119 3/** Array-based stack implementation */ class AStack<E> implements Stack<E> { 3private static final int defaultSize = 10; 3private int maxSize; private int top; private E [] listArray; 3// Maximum size of stack // Index for top Object // Array holding stack 3/** Constructors */ AStack() { this(defaultSize); } @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") // Generic array allocation AStack(int size) { maxSize = size; top = 0; listArray = (E[])new Object[size]; 3// Create listArray 3}', '} 3/** @return Stack size */ public int length() { return top; } 3Figure 4.19 Array-based stack class implementation. 3120 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Linked stack implementation */ class LStack<E> implements Stack<E> { 3private Link<E> top; private int size; 3// Pointer to first element // Number of elements 3/** Constructors */ public LStack() { top = null; size = 0; } public LStack(int size) { top = null; size = 0; }', '// Maximum size of list // Current # of list items // Position of current element // Array holding list elements 3/** Constructors */ /** Create a list with the default capacity. */ AList() { this(defaultSize); } /** Create a new list object. 3@param size Max # of elements list can contain. */ @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") // Generic array allocation AList(int size) { maxSize = size; listSize = curr = 0; listArray = (E[])new Object[size]; 3// Create listArray 3} 3public void clear()', '/** Reinitialize stack */ public void clear() { top = null; size = 0; } 3/** Put "it" on stack */ public void push(E it) { 3top = new Link<E>(it, top); size++; 3} 3/** Remove "it" from stack */ public E pop() { 3assert top != null : "Stack is empty"; E it = top.element(); top = top.next(); size--; return it; 3} 3/** @return Top value */ public E topValue() { 3assert top != null : "Stack is empty"; return top.element(); 3} 3/** @return Stack length */ public int length() { return size; }', 'The linked queue implementation is a straightforward adaptation of the linked list.

REASON: The score is 0.80 because while the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes, there are still several irrelevant nodes interspersed among the relevant ones. For instance, the third node (rank 3) provides an interface for the Stack ADT but does not directly contribute to the learning concepts, which affects the overall precision. Additionally, the fifth node (rank 5) discusses modifying stack code without directly relating to the key concepts, further lowering the score. However, the presence of multiple relevant nodes, such as the first (rank 1) and second (rank 2) nodes that discuss the array-based stack implementation and its efficiency, supports a solid contextual understanding.

                Context: ['The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', '4.6 Modify the code of Figure 4.19 to support storing variable-length strings of at most 255 characters. The stack array should have type char. A string is represented by a series of characters (one character per stack element), with the length of the string stored in the stack element immediately above the string itself, as illustrated by Figure 4.34. The push operation would store an element requiring i storage units in the i positions beginning with the current value of top and store the size in the position i storage units above top. The value of top would then be reset above the newly inserted element. The pop operation need only look at the size value stored in position top − 1 and then pop off the appropriate number of units. You may store the string on the stack in reverse order if you prefer, provided that when it is popped from the stack, it is returned in its proper order.', 'For the implementation of Figure 4.19, top is deﬁned to be the array index of the ﬁrst free position in the stack. Thus, an empty stack has top set to 0, the ﬁrst available free position in the array. (Alternatively, top could have been deﬁned to be the index for the top element in the stack, rather than the ﬁrst free position. If this had been done, the empty list would initialize top as −1.) Methods push and pop simply place an element into, or remove an element from, the array position indicated by top. Because top is assumed to be at the ﬁrst free position, push ﬁrst inserts its value into the top position and then increments top, while pop ﬁrst decrements top and then removes the top element.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter.

Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list.

                Context: ['5.1.1 The Full Binary Tree Theorem 3Some binary tree implementations store data only at the leaf nodes, using the inter- nal nodes to provide structure to the tree. More generally, binary tree implementa- tions might require some amount of space for internal nodes, and a different amount for leaf nodes. Thus, to analyze the space required by such implementations, it is useful to know the minimum and maximum fraction of the nodes that are leaves in a tree containing n internal nodes.', 'Two restricted forms of binary tree are sufﬁciently important to warrant special names. Each node in a full binary tree is either (1) an internal node with exactly two non-empty children or (2) a leaf. A complete binary tree has a restricted shape obtained by starting at the root and ﬁlling the tree by levels from left to right. In the complete binary tree of height d, all levels except possibly level d−1 are completely full. The bottom level has its nodes ﬁlled in from the left side.', '5.8 Write a recursive function that returns the height of a binary tree. 5.9 Write a recursive function that returns a count of the number of leaf nodes in 3a binary tree. 35.10 Assume that a given binary tree stores integer values in its nodes. Write a 3recursive function that sums the values of all nodes in the tree.', '4.4 Dictionaries 4.5 Further Reading 4.6 Exercises 4.7 Projects 35 Binary Trees 35.1 Deﬁnitions and Properties 35.1.1 The Full Binary Tree Theorem 5.1.2 A Binary Tree Node ADT 35.2 Binary Tree Traversals 5.3 Binary Tree Node Implementations 35.3.1 5.3.2 5.3.3 Array Implementation for Complete Binary Trees 3Pointer-Based Node Implementations Space Requirements 35.4 Binary Search Trees 5.5 Heaps and Priority Queues 5.6 Huffman Coding Trees', 'A BST is a binary tree that conforms to the following condition, known as the Binary Search Tree Property: All nodes stored in the left subtree of a node whose key value is K have key values less than K. All nodes stored in the right subtree of a node whose key value is K have key values greater than or equal to K. Figure 5.13 shows two BSTs for a collection of values. One consequence of the Binary Search Tree Property is that if the BST nodes are printed using an inorder traversal (see Section 5.2), the resulting enumeration will be in sorted order from lowest to highest.', 'Sec. 5.2 Binary Tree Traversals 3Theorem 5.2 The number of empty subtrees in a non-empty binary tree is one more than the number of nodes in the tree.', 'In Section 5.2, three tree traversals were presented for binary trees: preorder, pos- torder, and inorder. For general trees, preorder and postorder traversals are deﬁned with meanings similar to their binary tree counterparts. Preorder traversal of a gen- eral tree ﬁrst visits the root of the tree, then performs a preorder traversal of each subtree from left to right. A postorder traversal of a general tree performs a pos- torder traversal of the root’s subtrees from left to right, then visits the root. Inorder', 'When analyzing the space requirements for a binary tree implementation, it is useful to know how many empty subtrees a tree contains. A simple extension of the Full Binary Tree Theorem tells us exactly how many empty subtrees there are in any binary tree, whether full or not. Here are two approaches to proving the following theorem, and each suggests a useful way of thinking about binary trees. 3Sec. 5.2 Binary Tree Traversals', '(b) Modify the preorder traversal of Section 5.2 to perform a postorder 3traversal of a binary tree. 35.6 Write a recursive function named search that takes as input the pointer to the root of a binary tree (not a BST!) and a value K, and returns true if value K appears in the tree and false otherwise.', '5.2 One way to deal with the “problem” of null pointers in binary trees is to use that space for some other purpose. One example is the threaded binary tree. Extending the node implementation of Figure 5.7, the threaded binary tree stores with each node two additional bit ﬁelds that indicate if the child pointers lc and rc are regular pointers to child nodes or threads. If lc is not a pointer to a non-empty child (i.e., if it would be null in a regular binary tree), then it instead stores a pointer to the inorder predecessor of that node. The inorder predecessor is the node that would be printed immediately before the current node in an inorder traversal.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 1.0 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first ten nodes provide essential concepts such as the 'Full Binary Tree Theorem' and 'Binary Search Tree Property', while the irrelevant nodes, starting from the eleventh, 'do not provide relevant information about binary trees and their concepts'. This clear distinction in relevance justifies the perfect score.

REASON: The score is 0.44 because the relevant nodes are not ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. Specifically, the first four nodes are irrelevant, discussing binary tree properties, which detracts from the overall relevance. However, the score reflects that there are five relevant nodes ranked higher, including key concepts like 'dynamic general tree representation' and 'K-ary trees', which are essential for understanding non-binary trees.

The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation.

Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'A good sorting algorithm can be devised based on a tree structure more suited to the purpose. In particular, we would like the tree to be balanced, space efﬁcient, and fast. The algorithm should take advantage of the fact that sorting is a special- purpose application in that all of the values to be stored are available at the start. This means that we do not necessarily need to insert one value at a time into the tree structure.', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).

What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort.

The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation.

Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'A good sorting algorithm can be devised based on a tree structure more suited to the purpose. In particular, we would like the tree to be balanced, space efﬁcient, and fast. The algorithm should take advantage of the fact that sorting is a special- purpose application in that all of the values to be stored are available at the start. This means that we do not necessarily need to insert one value at a time into the tree structure.', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).

What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist.

Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved. Of the sorting algorithms Insertion Sort, Bub- ble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort, Binsort, and Radix Sort, which of these are stable, and which are not? For each one, describe either why it is or is not stable. If a minor change to the implemen- tation would make it stable, describe the change.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'A good sorting algorithm can be devised based on a tree structure more suited to the purpose. In particular, we would like the tree to be balanced, space efﬁcient, and fast. The algorithm should take advantage of the fact that sorting is a special- purpose application in that all of the values to be stored are available at the start. This means that we do not necessarily need to insert one value at a time into the tree structure.', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for', '7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', '7.11 Exercises 37.1 Using induction, prove that Insertion Sort will always produce a sorted array. 3257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', '7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms 3This section presents three simple sorting algorithms. While easy to understand and implement, we will soon see that they are unacceptably slow when there are many records to sort. Nonetheless, there are situations where one of these simple algorithms is the best tool for the job. 37.2.1 3Insertion Sort', 'Because sorting is so important, naturally it has been studied intensively and many algorithms have been devised. Some of these algorithms are straightforward adaptations of schemes we use in everyday life. Others are totally alien to how hu- mans do things, having been invented to sort thousands or even millions of records stored on the computer. After years of study, there are still unsolved problems related to sorting. New algorithms are still being developed and reﬁned for special- purpose applications.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases. The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'We sort many things in our everyday lives: A handful of cards when playing Bridge; bills and other piles of paper; jars of spices; and so on. And we have many intuitive strategies that we can use to do the sorting, depending on how many objects we have to sort and how hard they are to move around. Sorting is also one of the most frequently performed computing tasks. We might sort the records in a database so that we can search the collection efﬁciently. We might sort the records by zip code so that we can print and mail them more cheaply. We might use sorting as an intrinsic part of an algorithm to solve some other problem, such as when computing the minimum-cost spanning tree (see Section 11.5).', '8.4 Implement an external sort based on replacement selection and multiway merging as described in this chapter. Test your program both on ﬁles with small records and on ﬁles with large records. For what size record do you ﬁnd that key sorting would be worthwhile?', '1.18 How would you sort an array of about 1000 integers from lowest value to highest value? Write down at least ﬁve approaches to sorting the array. Do not write algorithms in Java or pseudocode. Just write a sentence or two for each approach to describe how it would work.']

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'Note however that the running time for sequential search will be roughly the same regardless of whether or not the array values are stored in order. In contrast, binary search requires that the array values be ordered from lowest to highest. De- pending on the context in which binary search is to be used, this requirement for a sorted array could be detrimental to the running time of a complete program, be- cause maintaining the values in sorted order requires to greater cost when inserting new elements into the array. This is an example of a tradeoff between the advan- tage of binary search during search and the disadvantage related to maintaining a sorted array. Only in the context of the complete problem to be solved can we know whether the advantage outweighs the disadvantage.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', 'she will ﬁrst open the dictionary about three quarters of the way through and then make a decision based on what is found as to where to look next. In other words, people typically use some knowledge about the expected distribution of key values to “compute” where to look next. This form of “computed” binary search is called a dictionary search or interpolation search.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'Note however that the running time for sequential search will be roughly the same regardless of whether or not the array values are stored in order. In contrast, binary search requires that the array values be ordered from lowest to highest. De- pending on the context in which binary search is to be used, this requirement for a sorted array could be detrimental to the running time of a complete program, be- cause maintaining the values in sorted order requires to greater cost when inserting new elements into the array. This is an example of a tradeoff between the advan- tage of binary search during search and the disadvantage related to maintaining a sorted array. Only in the context of the complete problem to be solved can we know whether the advantage outweighs the disadvantage.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', 'she will ﬁrst open the dictionary about three quarters of the way through and then make a decision based on what is found as to where to look next.

REASON: The score is 0.90 because the actual output incorrectly includes Sequential Search as a search algorithm, which is not mentioned in the retrieval context, leading to a slight misalignment.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'Note however that the running time for sequential search will be roughly the same regardless of whether or not the array values are stored in order. In contrast, binary search requires that the array values be ordered from lowest to highest. De- pending on the context in which binary search is to be used, this requirement for a sorted array could be detrimental to the running time of a complete program, be- cause maintaining the values in sorted order requires to greater cost when inserting new elements into the array. This is an example of a tradeoff between the advan- tage of binary search during search and the disadvantage related to maintaining a sorted array. Only in the context of the complete problem to be solved can we know whether the advantage outweighs the disadvantage.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', 'she will ﬁrst open the dictionary about three quarters of the way through and then make a decision based on what is found as to where to look next. In other words, people typically use some knowledge about the expected distribution of key values to “compute” where to look next. This form of “computed” binary search is called a dictionary search or interpolation search. In a dictionary search, we search L at a position p that is appropriate to the value of K as follows. 3p = 3K − L[1] L[n] − L[1]', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1.

REASON: The score is 0.90 because while the relevant nodes are mostly ranked higher, there are some irrelevant nodes that disrupt the overall ranking. Specifically, the sixth node discusses raw comparisons in binary search but does not introduce new concepts relevant to searching, which is why it is ranked lower than the relevant nodes. Additionally, the eighth and ninth nodes list sections and further reading without contributing to the understanding of searching concepts, further affecting the score.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle.

All were rather cumbersome, largely because no adequate method for handling updates was known. Typically, updates would cause the index to degrade in performance. ISAM is one example of such an index and was widely used by IBM prior to adoption of the B-tree.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'We can categorize search algorithms into three general approaches: 31.

However, we typically would like for the keys to deﬁne a total order (see Section 2.1), which means that we can tell which of two keys is greater than the other. Using key types with total orderings gives the database implementor the opportunity to organize a collection of records in a way that makes searching more efﬁcient. An example is storing the records in sorted order in an array, which permits a binary search. Fortunately, in practice most ﬁelds of most records consist of simple data types with natural total orders. For example, integers, ﬂoats, doubles, and character strings all are totally ordered. Ordering ﬁelds that are naturally multi-dimensional, such as a point in two or three dimensions, present special opportunities if we wish to take advantage of their multidimensional nature.

REASON: The score is 0.85 because while the relevant nodes are generally ranked higher, there are several irrelevant nodes interspersed that detract from the overall precision. For instance, the fourth node, which states, 'Recall from Section 8.2.1 that a cylinder is all of the tracks readable from a particular placement,' does not contribute to the understanding of indexing concepts and is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. However, the presence of multiple relevant nodes, such as the first node emphasizing that 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases,' supports a strong contextual precision score.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Indexing. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', '1Recall from Section 8.2.1 that a cylinder is all of the tracks readable from a particular placement 3of the heads on the multiple platters of a disk drive. 3347 3348 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3among the cylinders, sorting the records within each cylinder, and updating both the system index table and the within-cylinder block table. Such reorganization was typical of database systems during the 1960s and would normally be done each night or weekly. 310.3 Tree-based Indexing', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'Before the invention of effective tree indexing schemes, a variety of disk-based indexing methods were in use. All were rather cumbersome, largely because no adequate method for handling updates was known. Typically, updates would cause the index to degrade in performance. ISAM is one example of such an index and was widely used by IBM prior to adoption of the B-tree.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'We can categorize search algorithms into three general approaches: 31. Sequential and list methods. 2. Direct access by key value (hashing). 3. Tree indexing methods. 3This and the following chapter treat these three approaches in turn. Any of these approaches are potentially suitable for implementing the Dictionary ADT 3301 3302 3Chap. 9 Searching 3introduced in Section 4.4. However, each has different performance characteristics that make it the method of choice in particular circumstances.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3Linear IndexDatabase Records42739852375298374273 3Figure 10.1 Linear indexing for variable-length records.

At a minimum, we must be able to take two keys and reliably determine whether they are equal or not. That is enough to enable a sequential search through a database of records and ﬁnd one that matches a given key. However, we typically would like for the keys to deﬁne a total order (see Section 2.1), which means that we can tell which of two keys is greater than the other. Using key types with total orderings gives the database implementor the opportunity to organize a collection of records in a way that makes searching more efﬁcient. An example is storing the records in sorted order in an array, which permits a binary search. Fortunately, in practice most ﬁelds of most records consist of simple data types with natural total orders. For example, integers, ﬂoats, doubles, and character strings all are totally ordered. Ordering ﬁelds that are naturally multi-dimensional, such as a point in two or three dimensions, present special opportunities if we wish to take advantage of their multidimensional nature. This problem is addressed in Section 13.3.', '4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList.

Call n the number of elements currently in the list, P the size of a pointer in stor- age units (typically four bytes), E the size of a data element in storage units (this could be anything, from one bit for a Boolean variable on up to thousands of bytes or more for complex records), and D the maximum number of list elements that can be stored in the array. The amount of space required for the array-based list is', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons. Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'Class AList’s private portion contains the data members for the array-based list.

Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', 'The corresponding orthogonal array is shown in Figure 12.7. Here we have a list of row headers, each of which contains a pointer to a list of matrix records. A second list of column headers also contains pointers to matrix records. Each non-zero matrix element stores pointers to its non-zero neighbors in the row, both following and preceding it. Each non-zero element also stores pointers to its non- zero neighbors following and preceding it in the column. Thus, each non-zero element stores its own value, its position within the matrix, and four pointers. Non- zero elements are found by traversing a row or column list. Note that the ﬁrst non-zero element in a given row could be in any column; likewise, the neighboring non-zero element in any row or column list could be at any (higher) row or column in the array. Thus, each non-zero element must also store its row and column position explicitly.', 'Example 1.4 An ADT for a list of integers might specify the following operations: 3Insert a new integer at a particular position in the list. • Return true if the list is empty. • Reinitialize the list. • Return the number of integers currently in the list. • Delete the integer at a particular position in the list.

In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList.

Call n the number of elements currently in the list, P the size of a pointer in stor- age units (typically four bytes), E the size of a data element in storage units (this could be anything, from one bit for a Boolean variable on up to thousands of bytes or more for complex records), and D the maximum number of list elements that can be stored in the array. The amount of space required for the array-based list is', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons. Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order.

Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', 'The corresponding orthogonal array is shown in Figure 12.7. Here we have a list of row headers, each of which contains a pointer to a list of matrix records. A second list of column headers also contains pointers to matrix records. Each non-zero matrix element stores pointers to its non-zero neighbors in the row, both following and preceding it. Each non-zero element also stores pointers to its non- zero neighbors following and preceding it in the column. Thus, each non-zero element stores its own value, its position within the matrix, and four pointers. Non- zero elements are found by traversing a row or column list. Note that the ﬁrst non-zero element in a given row could be in any column; likewise, the neighboring non-zero element in any row or column list could be at any (higher) row or column in the array. Thus, each non-zero element must also store its row and column position explicitly.', 'Example 1.4 An ADT for a list of integers might specify the following operations: 3Insert a new integer at a particular position in the list. • Return true if the list is empty. • Reinitialize the list. • Return the number of integers currently in the list. • Delete the integer at a particular position in the list.

In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list.

Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2.

Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', 'The corresponding orthogonal array is shown in Figure 12.7. Here we have a list of row headers, each of which contains a pointer to a list of matrix records. A second list of column headers also contains pointers to matrix records. Each non-zero matrix element stores pointers to its non-zero neighbors in the row, both following and preceding it. Each non-zero element also stores pointers to its non- zero neighbors following and preceding it in the column. Thus, each non-zero element stores its own value, its position within the matrix, and four pointers. Non- zero elements are found by traversing a row or column list. Note that the ﬁrst non-zero element in a given row could be in any column; likewise, the neighboring non-zero element in any row or column list could be at any (higher) row or column in the array.

One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9022333222333222 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.90 because while the relevant nodes are predominantly ranked higher, there are some irrelevant nodes interspersed that detract from the overall precision. For instance, the sixth node discusses binary trees, which is not pertinent to advanced tree structures, and is ranked lower than the relevant nodes. Additionally, the eighth node also focuses on binary tree implementations, which further lowers the score. However, the presence of multiple relevant nodes, such as the first node discussing the AVL tree and the second node covering various balanced tree structures, contributes positively to the score.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.125 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.12 because the majority of the nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, with only one node (ranked 8th) mentioning 'Asymptotic Analysis', which is a key concept. The other nodes, such as the first node discussing 'Abstract Data Types and Data Structures', do not relate to the expected analysis techniques, leading to a low score. The presence of a relevant node contributes to the score, but the overwhelming number of irrelevant nodes keeps it from being higher.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lower Bounds. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', '1Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that any mention of bounds must specify what class of inputs are being considered. Do we mean the bound for the worst case input? The average cost over all inputs? Regardless of which class of inputs we consider, all of the issues raised apply equally. 3Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', 'Sec. 9.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 3T(n) = npn + 3n−1 (cid:88) 3(i + 1)pi. 3i=0 3What happens to the equation if we assume all the pi’s are equal (except p0)? 3T(n) = pnn + 3n−1 (cid:88) 3(i + 1)p 3= pnn + p 3i=0 n (cid:88) 3i 3i=1 n(n + 1) 2 1 − pn n(n + 1) 2 n n + 1 + pn(n − 1) 2 3= pnn + p 3= pnn + 3= 3Depending on the value of pn, n+1 32 ≤ T(n) ≤ n.', '[Man89] 3Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach. 3[MM04] 3[MM08] 3[P´ol57] 3[Pug90] W.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lower Bounds. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', '1Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that any mention of bounds must specify what class of inputs are being considered. Do we mean the bound for the worst case input? The average cost over all inputs?

However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm.

In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem).

Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', '4.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.88015873015873 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.88 because while the relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes, there are still several irrelevant nodes interspersed among them. For instance, the fourth node states, 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm,' which does not contribute to identifying key concepts related to lower bounds and is ranked lower than relevant nodes. This affects the overall precision score, as it indicates that not all relevant information is prioritized effectively.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lower Bounds. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', '1Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that any mention of bounds must specify what class of inputs are being considered. Do we mean the bound for the worst case input? The average cost over all inputs?

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lower Bounds. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', '1Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that any mention of bounds must specify what class of inputs are being considered. Do we mean the bound for the worst case input? The average cost over all inputs?

A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted. In general, a recursive algorithm must have two parts: the base case, which handles a simple input that can be solved without resorting to a recursive call, and the recursive part which contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm where the parameters are in some sense “closer” to the base case than those of the original call. Here is a recursive Java function to compute the factorial of n. A trace of fact’s execution for a small value of n is presented in Section 4.2.4.', 'The last speedup to be considered reduces the cost of making recursive calls.

For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).

A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted. In general, a recursive algorithm must have two parts: the base case, which handles a simple input that can be solved without resorting to a recursive call, and the recursive part which contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm where the parameters are in some sense “closer” to the base case than those of the original call. Here is a recursive Java function to compute the factorial of n. A trace of fact’s execution for a small value of n is presented in Section 4.2.4.', 'The last speedup to be considered reduces the cost of making recursive calls. Quicksort is inherently recursive, because each Quicksort operation must sort two sublists. Thus, there is no simple way to turn Quicksort into an iterative algorithm.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Limits to Computation. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Turing machines are a simple model of computation for writing programs that are language acceptors. There is a “universal” Turing machine that can take as in- put a description for a Turing machine, and an input string, and return the execution of that machine on that string. This Turing machine in turn can be cast as a Boolean expression such that the expression is satisﬁable if and only if the Turing machine yields ACCEPT for that string. Cook used Turing machines in his proof because they are simple enough that he could develop this transformation of Turing ma- chines to Boolean expressions, but rich enough to be able to compute any function that a regular computer can compute. The signiﬁcance of this transformation is that any decision problem that is performable by the Turing machine is transformable to SAT. Thus, SAT is N P-hard.', '17 Limits to Computation 317.1 Reductions 17.2 Hard Problems 317.2.1 The Theory of N P-Completeness 17.2.2 N P-Completeness Proofs 17.2.3 Coping with N P-Complete Problems 317.3 Impossible Problems 317.3.1 Uncountability 17.3.2 The Halting Problem Is Unsolvable 317.4 Further Reading 17.5 Exercises 17.6 Projects 3Bibliography 3Contents 3501 504 504 507 3509 509 511 513 515 515 516 522 523 523 524 526 527 532 532 533 3535 536 541 543 547 552 555 556 559 561 562 564 3567 3Contents 3Index 3xi 3573', 'Example 17.5 For arbitrary program P, does there exist any input for which P halts?
