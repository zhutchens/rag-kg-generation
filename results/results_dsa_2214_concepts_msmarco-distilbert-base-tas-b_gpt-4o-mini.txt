                Context: ['Our second graph traversal algorithm is known as a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS). BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices fur- ther away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom. Fig- ure 11.10 provides an implementation for the BFS algorithm. Figure 11.11 shows a graph and the corresponding breadth-ﬁrst search tree. Figure 11.12 illustrates the BFS process for the graph of Figure 11.11(a).', 'The previous section points out that a large fraction of the space in a typical binary tree node implementation is devoted to structural overhead, not to storing data. This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues (Section 5.5) and for external sorting algorithms (Section 8.5.2).', 'We begin in Section 11.1 with some basic graph terminology and then deﬁne two fundamental representations for graphs, the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.2 presents a graph ADT and simple implementations based on the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Min-heaps and max-heaps both have their uses. For example, the Heapsort of Section 7.6 uses the max-heap, while the Replacement Selection algorithm of Section 8.5.2 uses a min-heap.

This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key.

Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Data Structures and Algorithms. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Our second graph traversal algorithm is known as a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS). BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices fur- ther away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom. Fig- ure 11.10 provides an implementation for the BFS algorithm. Figure 11.11 shows a graph and the corresponding breadth-ﬁrst search tree. Figure 11.12 illustrates the BFS process for the graph of Figure 11.11(a).', 'The previous section points out that a large fraction of the space in a typical binary tree node implementation is devoted to structural overhead, not to storing data. This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues (Section 5.5) and for external sorting algorithms (Section 8.5.2).', 'We begin in Section 11.1 with some basic graph terminology and then deﬁne two fundamental representations for graphs, the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.2 presents a graph ADT and simple implementations based on the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Min-heaps and max-heaps both have their uses. For example, the Heapsort of Section 7.6 uses the max-heap, while the Replacement Selection algorithm of Section 8.5.2 uses a min-heap. The examples in the rest of this section will use a max-heap. 3Be careful not to confuse the logical representation of a heap with its physical implementation by means of the array-based complete binary tree. The two are not 34The term “heap” is also sometimes used to refer to a memory pool. See Section 12.3. 3171', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times.

This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.8095935314685314 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.81 because while there are several relevant nodes that provide key concepts such as 'breadth-first search (BFS)' (1st node), 'complete binary trees' (2nd node), and 'graph terminology' (3rd node), there are also multiple irrelevant nodes that rank higher than some relevant ones. For instance, the 5th node discusses implementing search algorithms, which does not directly relate to core concepts, and ranks higher than relevant nodes. This affects the overall score, as the presence of irrelevant nodes in higher ranks lowers the contextual precision.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Data Structures and Algorithms. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Our second graph traversal algorithm is known as a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS). BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices fur- ther away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom. Fig- ure 11.10 provides an implementation for the BFS algorithm. Figure 11.11 shows a graph and the corresponding breadth-ﬁrst search tree. Figure 11.12 illustrates the BFS process for the graph of Figure 11.11(a).', 'The previous section points out that a large fraction of the space in a typical binary tree node implementation is devoted to structural overhead, not to storing data. This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues (Section 5.5) and for external sorting algorithms (Section 8.5.2).', 'We begin in Section 11.1 with some basic graph terminology and then deﬁne two fundamental representations for graphs, the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.2 presents a graph ADT and simple implementations based on the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Min-heaps and max-heaps both have their uses. For example, the Heapsort of Section 7.6 uses the max-heap, while the Replacement Selection algorithm of Section 8.5.2 uses a min-heap. The examples in the rest of this section will use a max-heap. 3Be careful not to confuse the logical representation of a heap with its physical implementation by means of the array-based complete binary tree. The two are not 34The term “heap” is also sometimes used to refer to a memory pool. See Section 12.3. 3171', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times.

(c) Values 1 and 6 are swapped to form the ﬁnal heap. 3(a) The partially completed heap.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database.

Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done.

Choosing the median of ﬁve items can be done in constant time. 3Recursively, select M, the median of the n/5 medians-of-ﬁves. • Partition the list into those elements larger and smaller than M. 3Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting', 'Notice, however, that if we choose any constant c, and then if we pick the median from a sample of size n/c, then we can guarantee that we will discard at least n/2c elements. Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians.

To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it?

While the actual seek time is highly variable, depending on the distance between the track where the I/O head currently is and the track where the head is moving to, we will consider only two numbers. One is the track-to-track cost, or the minimum time necessary to move from a track to an adjacent track.

Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians.

To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5.

The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list.

Choosing the median of ﬁve items can be done in constant time. 3Recursively, select M, the median of the n/5 medians-of-ﬁves. • Partition the list into those elements larger and smaller than M. 3Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting', 'Notice, however, that if we choose any constant c, and then if we pick the median from a sample of size n/c, then we can guarantee that we will discard at least n/2c elements. Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians. The median of ﬁve elements is guaran- teed to have at least two in each partition.

Explain why this is true. Hint: The Master Theorem (Theorem 14.1) might help you. 315.8 Show that any comparison-based algorithm for ﬁnding the median must use 3at least n − 1 comparisons.', '15.13 Given an undirected graph G, the problem is to determine whether or not G is connected.

To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list. Here is a simple algorithm for ﬁnding the largest value.', 'Sec. 7.12 Projects 37.18 Which of the following operations are best implemented by ﬁrst sorting the list of numbers?

Choosing the median of ﬁve items can be done in constant time. 3Recursively, select M, the median of the n/5 medians-of-ﬁves. • Partition the list into those elements larger and smaller than M. 3Sec. 15.7 Optimal Sorting', 'Notice, however, that if we choose any constant c, and then if we pick the median from a sample of size n/c, then we can guarantee that we will discard at least n/2c elements. Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians. The median of ﬁve elements is guaran- teed to have at least two in each partition.

Explain why this is true.

This will be a function of both n and i, T(n, i).', 'Is it possible to modify our algorithm to get worst-case linear time? To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list. Here is a simple algorithm for ﬁnding the largest value.', 'Sec. 7.12 Projects 37.18 Which of the following operations are best implemented by ﬁrst sorting the list of numbers?

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.7942957042957043 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.79 because while several relevant nodes are ranked higher, there are also multiple irrelevant nodes interspersed among them. For instance, the first node discusses 'Choose the n/5 medians for groups of five elements from the list,' which is directly related to the concept of medians, while the fourth node about 'Implement the median-finding algorithm' is less relevant and ranks lower. This mix of relevant and irrelevant nodes affects the overall score, as the presence of irrelevant nodes dilutes the precision.

Actually, we can do better than this by selecting small subsets of a constant size (so we can ﬁnd the median of each in constant time), and then taking the median of these medians. Figure 15.5 illustrates this idea. This observation leads directly to the following algorithm.', 'Figure 15.5 A method for ﬁnding a pivot for partitioning a list that guarantees at least a ﬁxed fraction of the list will be in each partition. We divide the list into groups of ﬁve elements, and ﬁnd the median for each group. We then recursively ﬁnd the median of these n/5 medians.

This will be a function of both n and i, T(n, i).', 'Is it possible to modify our algorithm to get worst-case linear time? To do this, we need to pick a pivot that is guaranteed to discard a ﬁxed fraction of the elements. We cannot just choose a pivot at random, because doing so will not meet this guarantee. The ideal situation would be if we could pick the median value for the pivot each time. But that is essentially the same problem that we are trying to solve to begin with.', 'Despite the larger constant for the curve labeled 10n in Figure 3.1, 2n2 crosses it at the relatively small value of n = 5. What if we double the value of the constant in front of the linear equation? As shown in the graph, 20n is surpassed by 2n2 once n = 10. The additional factor of two for the linear growth rate does not much matter. It only doubles the x-coordinate for the intersection point. In general, changes to a constant factor in either equation only shift where the two curves cross, not whether the two curves cross.', 'How can we ﬁnd the ith largest value in a sorted list? Obviously we just go to the ith position. But what if we have an unsorted list? Can we do better than to sort it? If we are looking for the minimum or maximum value, certainly we can do better than sorting the list. Is this true for the second biggest value? For the median value? In later sections we will examine those questions. For this section, we will continue our examination of lower bounds proofs by reconsidering the simple problem of ﬁnding the maximum value in an unsorted list. Here is a simple algorithm for ﬁnding the largest value.', 'Sec. 7.12 Projects 37.18 Which of the following operations are best implemented by ﬁrst sorting the list of numbers?

While the actual seek time is highly variable, depending on the distance between the track where the I/O head currently is and the track where the head is moving to, we will consider only two numbers. One is the track-to-track cost, or the minimum time necessary to move from a track to an adjacent track.

What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size.

One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'Each call to insert takes Θ(log n) time in the worst case, because the value being inserted can move at most the distance from the bottom of the tree to the top of the tree.

If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n; T(1) = 1. 3Because a = 2, b = 2, c = 1, and k = 1, we ﬁnd that 2 = 21. Applying case (2) of the theorem, T(n) = Θ(n log n). 314.2.4 Average-Case Analysis of Quicksort 3In Section 7.5, we determined that the average-case analysis of Quicksort had the following recurrence: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], 3T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Analysis of Mergesort is straightforward, despite the fact that it is a recursive algorithm. The merging part takes time Θ(i) where i is the total length of the two subarrays being merged. The array to be sorted is repeatedly split in half until subarrays of size 1 are reached, at which time they are merged to be of size 2, these merged to subarrays of size 4, and so on as shown in Figure 7.8. Thus, the depth of the recursion is log n for n elements (assume for simplicity that n is a power of two). The ﬁrst level of recursion can be thought of as working on one array of size n, the next level working on two arrays of size n/2, the next on four arrays of size n/4, and so on. The bottom of the recursion has n arrays of size 1. Thus, n arrays of size 1 are merged (requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/2 arrays of size 2 (again requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/4 arrays of size 4, and so on. At each of the log n levels of recursion, Θ(n) work is done, for a total cost of Θ(n log n). This cost is unaffected by the relative order of the values being sorted, thus this analysis holds for the best, average, and worst cases.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm.

Often it is easy to derive a closed-form solution for the equation should it contain a recurrence or summation. But sometimes analysis proves more difﬁcult. It may take a clever insight to derive the right model, such as the snow- plow argument for analyzing the average run length resulting from Replacement Selection (Section 8.5.2). In this example, once the snowplow argument is under- stood, the resulting equations follow naturally. Sometimes, developing the model is straightforward but analyzing the resulting equations is not. An example is the average-case analysis for Quicksort. The equation given in Section 7.5 simply enu- merates all possible cases for the pivot position, summing corresponding costs for the recursive calls to Quicksort. However, deriving a closed-form solution for the resulting recurrence relation is not as easy.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n.

What is the least possible cost for any sorting algorithm in the worst case? The algorithm must at least look at every element in the input, just to determine that the input is truly sorted. Thus, any sorting algorithm must take at least cn time.

For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted.

The merging part takes time Θ(i) where i is the total length of the two subarrays being merged. The array to be sorted is repeatedly split in half until subarrays of size 1 are reached, at which time they are merged to be of size 2, these merged to subarrays of size 4, and so on as shown in Figure 7.8. Thus, the depth of the recursion is log n for n elements (assume for simplicity that n is a power of two). The ﬁrst level of recursion can be thought of as working on one array of size n, the next level working on two arrays of size n/2, the next on four arrays of size n/4, and so on. The bottom of the recursion has n arrays of size 1. Thus, n arrays of size 1 are merged (requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/2 arrays of size 2 (again requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/4 arrays of size 4, and so on. At each of the log n levels of recursion, Θ(n) work is done, for a total cost of Θ(n log n).

Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case.

What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size.

One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'Each call to insert takes Θ(log n) time in the worst case, because the value being inserted can move at most the distance from the bottom of the tree to the top of the tree.

Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n; T(1) = 1. 3Because a = 2, b = 2, c = 1, and k = 1, we ﬁnd that 2 = 21.

The merging part takes time Θ(i) where i is the total length of the two subarrays being merged. The array to be sorted is repeatedly split in half until subarrays of size 1 are reached, at which time they are merged to be of size 2, these merged to subarrays of size 4, and so on as shown in Figure 7.8. Thus, the depth of the recursion is log n for n elements (assume for simplicity that n is a power of two). The ﬁrst level of recursion can be thought of as working on one array of size n, the next level working on two arrays of size n/2, the next on four arrays of size n/4, and so on. The bottom of the recursion has n arrays of size 1. Thus, n arrays of size 1 are merged (requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/2 arrays of size 2 (again requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/4 arrays of size 4, and so on. At each of the log n levels of recursion, Θ(n) work is done, for a total cost of Θ(n log n). This cost is unaffected by the relative order of the values being sorted, thus this analysis holds for the best, average, and worst cases.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

Often it is easy to derive a closed-form solution for the equation should it contain a recurrence or summation. But sometimes analysis proves more difﬁcult. It may take a clever insight to derive the right model, such as the snow- plow argument for analyzing the average run length resulting from Replacement Selection (Section 8.5.2). In this example, once the snowplow argument is under- stood, the resulting equations follow naturally. Sometimes, developing the model is straightforward but analyzing the resulting equations is not. An example is the average-case analysis for Quicksort. The equation given in Section 7.5 simply enu- merates all possible cases for the pivot position, summing corresponding costs for the recursive calls to Quicksort. However, deriving a closed-form solution for the resulting recurrence relation is not as easy.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm?

Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 1.0 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The retrieval contexts provide comprehensive insights into key concepts of algorithm analysis, such as the importance of worst-case analysis and the complexities of various algorithms. There are no irrelevant nodes present, which contributes to the perfect score.

This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2).

However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'Each call to insert takes Θ(log n) time in the worst case, because the value being inserted can move at most the distance from the bottom of the tree to the top of the tree.

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n; T(1) = 1. 3Because a = 2, b = 2, c = 1, and k = 1, we ﬁnd that 2 = 21. Applying case (2) of the theorem, T(n) = Θ(n log n). 314.2.4 Average-Case Analysis of Quicksort 3In Section 7.5, we determined that the average-case analysis of Quicksort had the following recurrence: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], 3T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Analysis of Mergesort is straightforward, despite the fact that it is a recursive algorithm. The merging part takes time Θ(i) where i is the total length of the two subarrays being merged. The array to be sorted is repeatedly split in half until subarrays of size 1 are reached, at which time they are merged to be of size 2, these merged to subarrays of size 4, and so on as shown in Figure 7.8. Thus, the depth of the recursion is log n for n elements (assume for simplicity that n is a power of two). The ﬁrst level of recursion can be thought of as working on one array of size n, the next level working on two arrays of size n/2, the next on four arrays of size n/4, and so on. The bottom of the recursion has n arrays of size 1. Thus, n arrays of size 1 are merged (requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/2 arrays of size 2 (again requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/4 arrays of size 4, and so on. At each of the log n levels of recursion, Θ(n) work is done, for a total cost of Θ(n log n). This cost is unaffected by the relative order of the values being sorted, thus this analysis holds for the best, average, and worst cases.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'that can handle n airplanes quickly enough most of the time, but which fails to perform quickly enough when all n airplanes are coming from the same direction. For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', 'Often it is easy to invent an equation to model the behavior of an algorithm or data structure. Often it is easy to derive a closed-form solution for the equation should it contain a recurrence or summation. But sometimes analysis proves more difﬁcult. It may take a clever insight to derive the right model, such as the snow- plow argument for analyzing the average run length resulting from Replacement Selection (Section 8.5.2). In this example, once the snowplow argument is under- stood, the resulting equations follow naturally. Sometimes, developing the model is straightforward but analyzing the resulting equations is not. An example is the average-case analysis for Quicksort. The equation given in Section 7.5 simply enu- merates all possible cases for the pivot position, summing corresponding costs for the recursive calls to Quicksort. However, deriving a closed-form solution for the resulting recurrence relation is not as easy.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n.

What is the least possible cost for any sorting algorithm in the worst case? The algorithm must at least look at every element in the input, just to determine that the input is truly sorted. Thus, any sorting algorithm must take at least cn time. For many problems, this observation that each of the n inputs must be looked at leads to an easy Ω(n) lower bound.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted.

                Context: ['How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'Another common misconception is thinking that the best case for an algorithm occurs when the input size is as small as possible, or that the worst case occurs when the input size is as large as possible. What is correct is that best- and worse- case instances exist for each possible size of input. That is, for all inputs of a given size, say i, one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the best and one (or more) of the inputs of size i is the worst. Often (but not always!), we can characterize the best input case for an arbitrary size, and we can characterize the worst input case for an arbitrary size. Ideally, we can determine the growth rate for the characterized best, worst, and average cases as the input size grows.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array. If the pivot values are selected at random, then this is extremely unlikely to happen. When selecting the middle position of the current subarray, it 32The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'Each call to insert takes Θ(log n) time in the worst case, because the value being inserted can move at most the distance from the bottom of the tree to the top of the tree. Thus, to insert n values into the heap, if we insert them one at a time, will take Θ(n log n) time in the worst case.', 'Sec. 7.3 Shellsort 3Insertion Bubble Selection 3Comparisons: Best Case Average Case Worst Case 3Θ(n) Θ(n2) Θ(n2) 3Θ(n2) Θ(n2) Θ(n2) 3Θ(n2) Θ(n2) Θ(n2) 3Swaps: Best Case Average Case Worst Case 30 Θ(n2) Θ(n2) 30 Θ(n2) Θ(n2) 3Θ(n) Θ(n) Θ(n) 3Figure 7.5 A comparison of the asymptotic complexities for three simple sorting algorithms. 3array must move to reach their “correct” location (i.e., the number of inversions for each record).', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm. Otherwise, we often desire an average-case analysis if we know enough about the distribution of our input to compute the average case. If not, then we must resort to worst-case analysis. 33.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm?', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n; T(1) = 1. 3Because a = 2, b = 2, c = 1, and k = 1, we ﬁnd that 2 = 21. Applying case (2) of the theorem, T(n) = Θ(n log n). 314.2.4 Average-Case Analysis of Quicksort 3In Section 7.5, we determined that the average-case analysis of Quicksort had the following recurrence: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], 3T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Analysis of Mergesort is straightforward, despite the fact that it is a recursive algorithm. The merging part takes time Θ(i) where i is the total length of the two subarrays being merged. The array to be sorted is repeatedly split in half until subarrays of size 1 are reached, at which time they are merged to be of size 2, these merged to subarrays of size 4, and so on as shown in Figure 7.8. Thus, the depth of the recursion is log n for n elements (assume for simplicity that n is a power of two). The ﬁrst level of recursion can be thought of as working on one array of size n, the next level working on two arrays of size n/2, the next on four arrays of size n/4, and so on. The bottom of the recursion has n arrays of size 1. Thus, n arrays of size 1 are merged (requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/2 arrays of size 2 (again requiring Θ(n) total steps), n/4 arrays of size 4, and so on. At each of the log n levels of recursion, Θ(n) work is done, for a total cost of Θ(n log n). This cost is unaffected by the relative order of the values being sorted, thus this analysis holds for the best, average, and worst cases.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.', 'that can handle n airplanes quickly enough most of the time, but which fails to perform quickly enough when all n airplanes are coming from the same direction. For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'How is the worst-case cost of an algorithm expressed by the decision tree? The decision tree shows the decisions made by an algorithm for all possible inputs of a given size. Each path through the tree from the root to a leaf is one possible series of decisions taken by the algorithm. The depth of the deepest node represents the longest series of decisions required by the algorithm to reach an answer.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', 'Often it is easy to invent an equation to model the behavior of an algorithm or data structure. Often it is easy to derive a closed-form solution for the equation should it contain a recurrence or summation. But sometimes analysis proves more difﬁcult. It may take a clever insight to derive the right model, such as the snow- plow argument for analyzing the average run length resulting from Replacement Selection (Section 8.5.2). In this example, once the snowplow argument is under- stood, the resulting equations follow naturally. Sometimes, developing the model is straightforward but analyzing the resulting equations is not. An example is the average-case analysis for Quicksort. The equation given in Section 7.5 simply enu- merates all possible cases for the pivot position, summing corresponding costs for the recursive calls to Quicksort. However, deriving a closed-form solution for the resulting recurrence relation is not as easy.', 'Because the phrase “has an upper bound to its growth rate of f (n)” is long and often used when discussing algorithms, we adopt a special notation, called big-Oh notation. If the upper bound for an algorithm’s growth rate (for, say, the worst case) is f (n), then we would write that this algorithm is “in the set O(f (n))in the worst case” (or just “in O(f (n))in the worst case”). For example, if n2 grows as fast as T(n) (the running time of our algorithm) for the worst-case input, we would say the algorithm is “in O(n2) in the worst case.”', 'for a faster algorithm? Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met.', '(a) ﬁrst-ﬁt allocation will work, but not best ﬁt or worst ﬁt.

A recurrence relation deﬁnes a function by means of an expression that includes one or more (smaller) instances of itself.

Given a new machine that is 64 times as fast, how many inputs could we process in t seconds?', 'Let us look ahead to analyzing the problem of sorting to see how this process works. What is the least possible cost for any sorting algorithm in the worst case? The algorithm must at least look at every element in the input, just to determine that the input is truly sorted. Thus, any sorting algorithm must take at least cn time. For many problems, this observation that each of the n inputs must be looked at leads to an easy Ω(n) lower bound.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted. In general, a recursive algorithm must have two parts: the base case, which handles a simple input that can be solved without resorting to a recursive call, and the recursive part which contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm where the parameters are in some sense “closer” to the base case than those of the original call.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'The accessible element of the stack is called the top element. Elements are not said to be inserted, they are pushed onto the stack. When removed, an element is said to be popped from the stack. Figure 4.18 shows a sample stack ADT. 3As with lists, there are many variations on stack implementation. The two ap- proaches presented here are array-based and linked stacks, which are analogous to array-based and linked lists, respectively. 34.2.1 Array-Based Stacks', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'The linked stack implementation is quite simple. The freelist of Section 4.1.2 is an example of a linked stack. Elements are inserted and removed only from the head of the list. A header node is not used because no special-case code is required for lists of zero or one elements. Figure 4.20 shows the complete linked stack implementation. The only data member is top, a pointer to the ﬁrst (top) link node of the stack. Method push ﬁrst modiﬁes the next ﬁeld of the newly created link node to point to the top of the stack and then sets top to point to the new link node. Method pop is also quite simple. Variable temp stores the top nodes’ value, while ltemp links to the top node as it is removed from the stack. The stack is updated by setting top to point to the next link in the stack. The old top node is then returned to free store (or the freelist), and the element value is returned.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', '4.6 Modify the code of Figure 4.19 to support storing variable-length strings of at most 255 characters. The stack array should have type char. A string is represented by a series of characters (one character per stack element), with the length of the string stored in the stack element immediately above the string itself, as illustrated by Figure 4.34. The push operation would store an element requiring i storage units in the i positions beginning with the current value of top and store the size in the position i storage units above top. The value of top would then be reset above the newly inserted element. The pop operation need only look at the size value stored in position top − 1 and then pop off the appropriate number of units. You may store the string on the stack in reverse order if you prefer, provided that when it is popped from the stack, it is returned in its proper order.', 'For the implementation of Figure 4.19, top is deﬁned to be the array index of the ﬁrst free position in the stack. Thus, an empty stack has top set to 0, the ﬁrst available free position in the array. (Alternatively, top could have been deﬁned to be the index for the top element in the stack, rather than the ﬁrst free position. If this had been done, the empty list would initialize top as −1.) Methods push and pop simply place an element into, or remove an element from, the array position indicated by top. Because top is assumed to be at the ﬁrst free position, push ﬁrst inserts its value into the top position and then increments top, while pop ﬁrst decrements top and then removes the top element.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'maintain this property. Inserting or removing elements at the tail of the list is easy, so the append operation takes Θ(1) time. But if we wish to insert an element at the head of the list, all elements currently in the list must shift one position toward the tail to make room, as illustrated by Figure 4.3. This process takes Θ(n) time if there are n elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position i within a list of n elements, then n − i elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap.

One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'The accessible element of the stack is called the top element. Elements are not said to be inserted, they are pushed onto the stack. When removed, an element is said to be popped from the stack. Figure 4.18 shows a sample stack ADT. 3As with lists, there are many variations on stack implementation.

The freelist of Section 4.1.2 is an example of a linked stack. Elements are inserted and removed only from the head of the list. A header node is not used because no special-case code is required for lists of zero or one elements. Figure 4.20 shows the complete linked stack implementation. The only data member is top, a pointer to the ﬁrst (top) link node of the stack. Method push ﬁrst modiﬁes the next ﬁeld of the newly created link node to point to the top of the stack and then sets top to point to the new link node. Method pop is also quite simple. Variable temp stores the top nodes’ value, while ltemp links to the top node as it is removed from the stack. The stack is updated by setting top to point to the next link in the stack. The old top node is then returned to free store (or the freelist), and the element value is returned.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', '4.6 Modify the code of Figure 4.19 to support storing variable-length strings of at most 255 characters. The stack array should have type char. A string is represented by a series of characters (one character per stack element), with the length of the string stored in the stack element immediately above the string itself, as illustrated by Figure 4.34. The push operation would store an element requiring i storage units in the i positions beginning with the current value of top and store the size in the position i storage units above top. The value of top would then be reset above the newly inserted element. The pop operation need only look at the size value stored in position top − 1 and then pop off the appropriate number of units. You may store the string on the stack in reverse order if you prefer, provided that when it is popped from the stack, it is returned in its proper order.', 'For the implementation of Figure 4.19, top is deﬁned to be the array index of the ﬁrst free position in the stack.

(Alternatively, top could have been deﬁned to be the index for the top element in the stack, rather than the ﬁrst free position. If this had been done, the empty list would initialize top as −1.) Methods push and pop simply place an element into, or remove an element from, the array position indicated by top.

This process takes Θ(n) time if there are n elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position i within a list of n elements, then n − i elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap.

REASON: The score is 0.93 because the relevant nodes are well-ranked, with the first five nodes providing essential information about stacks and queues. However, the presence of three irrelevant nodes ranked higher than some relevant ones slightly lowers the score. Specifically, the sixth node discusses modifying code for variable-length strings, which is not directly related to the key concepts of lists, stacks, or queues, and is ranked above relevant nodes like the one explaining the Link class used for linked lists.

This process takes Θ(n) time if there are n elements already in the list. If we wish to insert at position i within a list of n elements, then n − i elements must shift toward the tail. Removing an element from the head of the list is similar in that all remaining elements must shift toward the head by one position to ﬁll in the gap. To remove the element at position i, n − i − 1 elements must shift toward the head. In the average case, insertion or removal requires moving half of the elements, which is Θ(n).', '@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop(); 3/** @return A copy of the top element. */ public E topValue(); 3/** @return The number of elements in the stack. */ public int length(); 3}; 3Figure 4.18 The stack ADT.', '// Create listArray 3} 3/** Reinitialize stack */ public void clear() { top = 0; } 3/** Push "it" onto stack */ public void push(E it) { 3assert top != maxSize : "Stack is full"; listArray[top++] = it; 3} 3/** Remove and top element */ public E pop() { 3assert top != 0 : "Stack is empty"; return listArray[--top]; 3} 3/** @return Top element */ public E topValue() { 3assert top != 0 : "Stack is empty"; return listArray[top-1]; 3} 3/** @return Stack size */ public int length() { return top; }', '/** Reinitialize stack */ public void clear() { top = null; size = 0; } 3/** Put "it" on stack */ public void push(E it) { 3top = new Link<E>(it, top); size++; 3} 3/** Remove "it" from stack */ public E pop() { 3assert top != null : "Stack is empty"; E it = top.element(); top = top.next(); size--; return it; 3} 3/** @return Top value */ public E topValue() { 3assert top != null : "Stack is empty"; return top.element(); 3} 3/** @return Stack length */ public int length() { return size; }', 'The linked queue implementation is a straightforward adaptation of the linked list.

All nodes stored in the right subtree of a node whose key value is K have key values greater than or equal to K. Figure 5.13 shows two BSTs for a collection of values.

Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it.

REASON: The score is 0.80 because the actual output inaccurately categorizes the Full Binary Tree Theorem as a concept rather than recognizing it as a specific type of binary tree, and it misclassifies Huffman Coding Trees as a type of tree instead of an example of a full binary tree.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.811024531024531 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.81 because while the relevant nodes are generally ranked higher, there are several irrelevant nodes that disrupt the overall ranking. For instance, the third node (rank 3) is irrelevant as it 'does not provide relevant information about binary trees,' which affects the score. However, the presence of multiple relevant nodes, such as the first node (rank 1) that 'explains the Binary Search Tree Property,' contributes positively to the score.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.4014473621616479 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.40 because the relevant nodes are not consistently ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node is irrelevant as it states, 'Sec. 5.2 Binary Tree Traversals does not provide relevant information about non-binary trees,' which should be ranked lower than the third node that directly addresses non-binary trees with, 'Note that this representation for serializing general trees...'. This inconsistency in ranking leads to a lower score.

Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever.

Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', '7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases. The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort).

While easy to understand and implement, we will soon see that they are unacceptably slow when there are many records to sort. Nonetheless, there are situations where one of these simple algorithms is the best tool for the job. 37.2.1 3Insertion Sort', 'lowindex = j; 3// Put it in place 3DSutil.swap(A, i, lowindex); 3} 3} 3Selection Sort (as written here) is essentially a Bubble Sort, except that rather than repeatedly swapping adjacent values to get the next smallest record into place, we instead remember the position of the element to be selected and do one swap at the end. Thus, the number of comparisons is still Θ(n2), but the number of swaps is much less than that required by bubble sort. Selection Sort is particularly 3229 3230', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'A good sorting algorithm can be devised based on a tree structure more suited to the purpose. In particular, we would like the tree to be balanced, space efﬁcient, and fast. The algorithm should take advantage of the fact that sorting is a special- purpose application in that all of the values to be stored are available at the start. This means that we do not necessarily need to insert one value at a time into the tree structure.', 'We use binary insert to place the losers. However, we are free to choose the best ordering for inserting, keeping in mind the fact that binary search has the same cost for 2i through 2i+1 − 1 items. For example, binary search requires three comparisons in the worst case for lists of size 4, 5, 6, or 7. So we pick the order of inserts to optimize the binary searches, which means picking an order that avoids growing a sublist size such that it crosses the boundary on list size to require an additional comparison. This sort is called merge insert sort, and also known as the Ford and Johnson sort.']

However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted.

The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort).

All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for', '7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms 3This section presents three simple sorting algorithms. While easy to understand and implement, we will soon see that they are unacceptably slow when there are many records to sort. Nonetheless, there are situations where one of these simple algorithms is the best tool for the job. 37.2.1 3Insertion Sort', 'lowindex = j; 3// Put it in place 3DSutil.swap(A, i, lowindex); 3} 3} 3Selection Sort (as written here) is essentially a Bubble Sort, except that rather than repeatedly swapping adjacent values to get the next smallest record into place, we instead remember the position of the element to be selected and do one swap at the end. Thus, the number of comparisons is still Θ(n2), but the number of swaps is much less than that required by bubble sort. Selection Sort is particularly 3229 3230', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'A good sorting algorithm can be devised based on a tree structure more suited to the purpose. In particular, we would like the tree to be balanced, space efﬁcient, and fast. The algorithm should take advantage of the fact that sorting is a special- purpose application in that all of the values to be stored are available at the start. This means that we do not necessarily need to insert one value at a time into the tree structure.', 'We use binary insert to place the losers. However, we are free to choose the best ordering for inserting, keeping in mind the fact that binary search has the same cost for 2i through 2i+1 − 1 items. For example, binary search requires three comparisons in the worst case for lists of size 4, 5, 6, or 7. So we pick the order of inserts to optimize the binary searches, which means picking an order that avoids growing a sublist size such that it crosses the boundary on list size to require an additional comparison. This sort is called merge insert sort, and also known as the Ford and Johnson sort.']

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.8698056953939307 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.87 because while most relevant nodes are ranked higher, there are a few irrelevant nodes that disrupt the overall ranking. For instance, the fourth node discusses 'relaxed for special-purpose sorting applications', which is vague and does not contribute specific learning concepts, thus it is ranked lower. Additionally, the eighth node mentions 'Existing snowFuture snowFalling SnowSnowplow MovementStart time T', which is completely irrelevant to file processing concepts. However, the score remains high due to the presence of multiple relevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'Replacement selection views RAM as consisting of an array of size M', which is directly relevant to understanding memory management in file processing.

Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'As an interesting aside, writing a correct binary search algorithm is not easy.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times.

This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'As an interesting aside, writing a correct binary search algorithm is not easy.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'As an interesting aside, writing a correct binary search algorithm is not easy.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes.

Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'Example 1.5 Two popular implementations for large disk-based database applications are hashing (Section 9.4) and the B+-tree (Section 10.5).

On the other hand, the B+-tree can perform range queries efﬁciently, while hashing is hopelessly inefﬁcient for range queries.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Indexing. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Before the invention of effective tree indexing schemes, a variety of disk-based indexing methods were in use. All were rather cumbersome, largely because no adequate method for handling updates was known. Typically, updates would cause the index to degrade in performance. ISAM is one example of such an index and was widely used by IBM prior to adoption of the B-tree.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'Example 1.5 Two popular implementations for large disk-based database applications are hashing (Section 9.4) and the B+-tree (Section 10.5). Both support efﬁcient insertion and deletion of records, and both support exact- match queries. However, hashing is more efﬁcient than the B+-tree for exact-match queries. On the other hand, the B+-tree can perform range queries efﬁciently, while hashing is hopelessly inefﬁcient for range queries. Thus, if the database application limits searches to exact-match queries, hashing is preferred. On the other hand, if the application requires support for range queries, the B+-tree is preferred. Despite these performance is- sues, both implementations solve versions of the same problem: updating and searching a large collection of records.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3Linear IndexDatabase Records42739852375298374273 3Figure 10.1 Linear indexing for variable-length records.

Hash tables allow for extremely fast exact-match search. A record can be modiﬁed quickly when the modiﬁcation does not affect its space requirements. Hash tables also support efﬁcient insertion of new records. While deletions can also be supported efﬁciently, too many deletions lead to some degradation in performance for the remaining operations. However, the hash table can be reorganized periodically to restore the system to peak efﬁciency.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Before the invention of effective tree indexing schemes, a variety of disk-based indexing methods were in use. All were rather cumbersome, largely because no adequate method for handling updates was known. Typically, updates would cause the index to degrade in performance. ISAM is one example of such an index and was widely used by IBM prior to adoption of the B-tree.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'Example 1.5 Two popular implementations for large disk-based database applications are hashing (Section 9.4) and the B+-tree (Section 10.5). Both support efﬁcient insertion and deletion of records, and both support exact- match queries. However, hashing is more efﬁcient than the B+-tree for exact-match queries. On the other hand, the B+-tree can perform range queries efﬁciently, while hashing is hopelessly inefﬁcient for range queries. Thus, if the database application limits searches to exact-match queries, hashing is preferred. On the other hand, if the application requires support for range queries, the B+-tree is preferred. Despite these performance is- sues, both implementations solve versions of the same problem: updating and searching a large collection of records.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3Linear IndexDatabase Records42739852375298374273 3Figure 10.1 Linear indexing for variable-length records. Each record in the index ﬁle is of ﬁxed length and contains a pointer to the beginning of the corre- sponding record in the database ﬁle. 310.1 Linear Indexing', '1Recall from Section 8.2.1 that a cylinder is all of the tracks readable from a particular placement 3of the heads on the multiple platters of a disk drive. 3347 3348 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3among the cylinders, sorting the records within each cylinder, and updating both the system index table and the within-cylinder block table. Such reorganization was typical of database systems during the 1960s and would normally be done each night or weekly. 310.3 Tree-based Indexing', 'When considering the choice of data structure to use in the database system that manages customer accounts, we see that a data structure that has little concern for the cost of deletion, but is highly efﬁcient for search and moderately efﬁcient for insertion, should meet the resource constraints imposed by this problem. Records are accessible by unique account number (sometimes called an exact-match query). One data structure that meets these requirements is the hash table described in Chapter 9.4. Hash tables allow for extremely fast exact-match search. A record can be modiﬁed quickly when the modiﬁcation does not affect its space requirements. Hash tables also support efﬁcient insertion of new records. While deletions can also be supported efﬁciently, too many deletions lead to some degradation in performance for the remaining operations. However, the hash table can be reorganized periodically to restore the system to peak efﬁciency. Such reorganization can occur ofﬂine so as not to affect ATM transactions.', 'second-level index is stored in main memory, accessing a record by this method requires two disk reads: one from the index ﬁle and one from the database ﬁle for the actual record.', '10.1 Implement a two-level linear index for variable-length records as illustrated by Figures 10.1 and 10.2. Assume that disk blocks are 1024 bytes in length. Records in the database ﬁle should typically range between 20 and 200 bytes, including a 4-byte key value. Each record of the index ﬁle should store a key value and the byte offset in the database ﬁle for the ﬁrst byte of the corresponding record. The top-level index (stored in memory) should be a simple array storing the lowest key value on the corresponding block in the index ﬁle.', '9.4.1 Hash Functions 9.4.2 Open Hashing 9.4.3 Closed Hashing 9.4.4 Analysis of Closed Hashing 9.4.5 Deletion 9.5 Further Reading 9.6 Exercises 9.7 Projects 310 Indexing 310.1 Linear Indexing 10.2 ISAM 10.3 Tree-based Indexing 10.4 2-3 Trees 10.5 B-Trees 310.5.1 B+-Trees 3vii 3265 265 268 268 272 274 282 283 285 288 290 295 295 299 3301 302 307 313 314 315 320 321 331 334 335 336 338 3341 343 346 348 350 355 358 3viii 310.5.2 B-Tree Analysis 310.6 Further Reading 10.7 Exercises 10.8 Projects']

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', '// Maximum size of list // Current # of list items // Position of current element // Array holding list elements 3/** Constructors */ /** Create a list with the default capacity. */ AList() { this(defaultSize); } /** Create a new list object. 3@param size Max # of elements list can contain. */ @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") // Generic array allocation AList(int size) { maxSize = size; listSize = curr = 0; listArray = (E[])new Object[size]; 3// Create listArray 3} 3public void clear()', '// Copy the element 3listArray[i] = listArray[i+1]; 3listSize--; return it; 3// Decrement size 3} 3Figure 4.2 An array-based list implementation. 3Sec. 4.1 Lists 3public void moveToStart() { curr = 0; } // Set to front public void moveToEnd() { curr = listSize; } // Set at end public void prev() { if (curr != 0) curr--; } // Back up public void next() { if (curr < listSize) curr++; } 3/** @return List size */ public int length() { return listSize; }', 'Given a pointer to a suitable location in the list, the insert and remove methods for linked lists require only Θ(1) time. Array-based lists must shift the re- mainder of the list up or down within the array. This requires Θ(n) time in the aver- age and worst cases. For many applications, the time to insert and delete elements dominates all other operations. For this reason, linked lists are often preferred to array-based lists.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'A simple formula can be used to determine whether the array-based list or linked list implementation will be more space efﬁcient in a particular situation. Call n the number of elements currently in the list, P the size of a pointer in stor- age units (typically four bytes), E the size of a data element in storage units (this could be anything, from one bit for a Boolean variable on up to thousands of bytes or more for complex records), and D the maximum number of list elements that can be stored in the array.

Here we have a list of row headers, each of which contains a pointer to a list of matrix records. A second list of column headers also contains pointers to matrix records. Each non-zero matrix element stores pointers to its non-zero neighbors in the row, both following and preceding it. Each non-zero element also stores pointers to its non- zero neighbors following and preceding it in the column. Thus, each non-zero element stores its own value, its position within the matrix, and four pointers. Non- zero elements are found by traversing a row or column list. Note that the ﬁrst non-zero element in a given row could be in any column; likewise, the neighboring non-zero element in any row or column list could be at any (higher) row or column in the array.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists and Arrays Revisited. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2.

REASON: The score is 0.95 because while the relevant nodes are predominantly ranked higher, there are a few irrelevant nodes that appear in the top rankings. Specifically, the sixth node discusses constructor details for the AList class, which is not directly related to the key concepts of lists and arrays, and the tenth node describes an example of inserting elements in an array-based list without contributing to broader concepts. This lowers the score slightly, but the majority of the relevant nodes effectively cover essential topics such as the advantages of linked lists, time complexity comparisons, and space efficiency, which justifies the high score.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists and Arrays Revisited. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', '// Maximum size of list // Current # of list items // Position of current element // Array holding list elements 3/** Constructors */ /** Create a list with the default capacity. */ AList() { this(defaultSize); } /** Create a new list object. 3@param size Max # of elements list can contain. */ @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") // Generic array allocation AList(int size) { maxSize = size; listSize = curr = 0; listArray = (E[])new Object[size]; 3// Create listArray 3} 3public void clear()', '// Copy the element 3listArray[i] = listArray[i+1]; 3listSize--; return it; 3// Decrement size 3} 3Figure 4.2 An array-based list implementation. 3Sec. 4.1 Lists 3public void moveToStart() { curr = 0; } // Set to front public void moveToEnd() { curr = listSize; } // Set at end public void prev() { if (curr != 0) curr--; } // Back up public void next() { if (curr < listSize) curr++; } 3/** @return List size */ public int length() { return listSize; }', 'Given a pointer to a suitable location in the list, the insert and remove methods for linked lists require only Θ(1) time. Array-based lists must shift the re- mainder of the list up or down within the array. This requires Θ(n) time in the aver- age and worst cases. For many applications, the time to insert and delete elements dominates all other operations. For this reason, linked lists are often preferred to array-based lists.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'A simple formula can be used to determine whether the array-based list or linked list implementation will be more space efﬁcient in a particular situation. Call n the number of elements currently in the list, P the size of a pointer in stor- age units (typically four bytes), E the size of a data element in storage units (this could be anything, from one bit for a Boolean variable on up to thousands of bytes or more for complex records), and D the maximum number of list elements that can be stored in the array. The amount of space required for the array-based list is', 'Insert 23:12203813122083382012132313(a)(b)(c)501244321012345503 3Figure 4.3 Inserting an element at the head of an array-based list requires shift- ing all existing elements in the array by one position toward the tail. (a) A list containing ﬁve elements before inserting an element with value 23. (b) The list after shifting all existing elements one position to the right. (c) The list after 23 has been inserted in array position 0. Shading indicates the unused part of the array.', 'The corresponding orthogonal array is shown in Figure 12.7. Here we have a list of row headers, each of which contains a pointer to a list of matrix records. A second list of column headers also contains pointers to matrix records. Each non-zero matrix element stores pointers to its non-zero neighbors in the row, both following and preceding it. Each non-zero element also stores pointers to its non- zero neighbors following and preceding it in the column. Thus, each non-zero element stores its own value, its position within the matrix, and four pointers. Non- zero elements are found by traversing a row or column list. Note that the ﬁrst non-zero element in a given row could be in any column; likewise, the neighboring non-zero element in any row or column list could be at any (higher) row or column in the array. Thus, each non-zero element must also store its row and column position explicitly.', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons. Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', 'RBACDEF 3Figure 6.9 The “list of children” implementation for general trees.

REASON: The score is 0.78 because while several relevant nodes are present, there are also multiple irrelevant nodes that rank higher than some relevant ones. For instance, the third node ranks higher but 'provides a table of contents and does not directly reference any specific learning concepts related to advanced tree structures.' Additionally, the sixth node ranks higher but 'discusses binary trees but does not provide specific learning concepts related to advanced tree structures.'

In the con- text of algorithm analysis, simulation is distinct from empirical comparison of two competitors because the purpose of the simulation is to perform analysis that might otherwise be too difﬁcult. A good example of this appears in Figure 9.10. This ﬁgure shows the cost for inserting or deleting a record from a hash table under two different assumptions for the policy used to ﬁnd a free slot in the table. The y axes is the cost in number of hash table slots evaluated, and the x axes is the percentage of slots in the table that are full. The mathematical equations for these curves can be determined, but this is not so easy. A reasonable alternative is to write simple variations on hashing. By timing the cost of the program for various loading con- ditions, it is not difﬁcult to construct a plot similar to Figure 9.10. The purpose of this analysis is not to determine which approach to hashing is most efﬁcient, so we are not doing empirical comparison of hashing alternatives. Instead, the purpose is to analyze the proper loading factor that would be used in an efﬁcient hashing system to balance time cost versus hash table size (space cost).', 'Data types have both a logical and a physical form.

In the con- text of algorithm analysis, simulation is distinct from empirical comparison of two competitors because the purpose of the simulation is to perform analysis that might otherwise be too difﬁcult. A good example of this appears in Figure 9.10. This ﬁgure shows the cost for inserting or deleting a record from a hash table under two different assumptions for the policy used to ﬁnd a free slot in the table. The y axes is the cost in number of hash table slots evaluated, and the x axes is the percentage of slots in the table that are full. The mathematical equations for these curves can be determined, but this is not so easy. A reasonable alternative is to write simple variations on hashing. By timing the cost of the program for various loading con- ditions, it is not difﬁcult to construct a plot similar to Figure 9.10. The purpose of this analysis is not to determine which approach to hashing is most efﬁcient, so we are not doing empirical comparison of hashing alternatives.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Another approach to analysis is simulation. The idea of simulation is to model the problem with a computer program and then run it to get a result. In the con- text of algorithm analysis, simulation is distinct from empirical comparison of two competitors because the purpose of the simulation is to perform analysis that might otherwise be too difﬁcult. A good example of this appears in Figure 9.10. This ﬁgure shows the cost for inserting or deleting a record from a hash table under two different assumptions for the policy used to ﬁnd a free slot in the table. The y axes is the cost in number of hash table slots evaluated, and the x axes is the percentage of slots in the table that are full. The mathematical equations for these curves can be determined, but this is not so easy. A reasonable alternative is to write simple variations on hashing. By timing the cost of the program for various loading con- ditions, it is not difﬁcult to construct a plot similar to Figure 9.10. The purpose of this analysis is not to determine which approach to hashing is most efﬁcient, so we are not doing empirical comparison of hashing alternatives. Instead, the purpose is to analyze the proper loading factor that would be used in an efﬁcient hashing system to balance time cost versus hash table size (space cost).', 'Data types have both a logical and a physical form. The deﬁnition of the data type in terms of an ADT is its logical form. The implementation of the data type as a data structure is its physical form. Figure 1.1 illustrates this relationship between logical and physical forms for data types. When you implement an ADT, you are dealing with the physical form of the associated data type. When you use an ADT elsewhere in your program, you are concerned with the associated data type’s logical form. Some sections of this book focus on physical implementations for a', 'A data type is a type together with a collection of operations to manipulate the type.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3Big-Oh notation describes an upper bound. In other words, big-Oh notation states a claim about the greatest amount of some resource (usually time) that is required by an algorithm for some class of inputs of size n (typically the worst such input, the average of all possible inputs, or the best such input).', 'A simple estimate for a problem’s lower bound can be obtained by measuring the size of the input that must be read and the output that must be written. Certainly no algorithm can be more efﬁcient than the problem’s I/O time. From this we see that the sorting problem cannot be solved by any algorithm in less than Ω(n) time because it takes at least n steps to read and write the n values to be sorted. Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order. So, based on our current knowledge of sorting algorithms and the size of the input, we know that the problem of sorting is bounded by Ω(n) and O(n log n).', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion.

However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3Big-Oh notation describes an upper bound. In other words, big-Oh notation states a claim about the greatest amount of some resource (usually time) that is required by an algorithm for some class of inputs of size n (typically the worst such input, the average of all possible inputs, or the best such input).', 'A simple estimate for a problem’s lower bound can be obtained by measuring the size of the input that must be read and the output that must be written. Certainly no algorithm can be more efﬁcient than the problem’s I/O time. From this we see that the sorting problem cannot be solved by any algorithm in less than Ω(n) time because it takes at least n steps to read and write the n values to be sorted. Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order. So, based on our current knowledge of sorting algorithms and the size of the input, we know that the problem of sorting is bounded by Ω(n) and O(n log n).', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion.

                Context: ['Dynamic programming is a powerful alternative to the standard principle of divide and conquer. In divide and conquer, a problem is split into subproblems, the subproblems are solved (independently), and then recombined into a solution for the problem being solved. Dynamic programming is appropriate whenever (1) subproblems are solved repeatedly, and (2) we can ﬁnd a suitable way of doing the necessary bookkeeping. Dynamic programming algorithms are usually not imple- mented by simply using a table to store subproblems for recursive calls (i.e., going backwards as is done by fibrt). Instead, such algorithms are typically imple- mented by building the table of subproblems from the bottom up. Thus, fibi bet- ter represents the most common form of dynamic programming than does fibrt, even though it doesn’t use the complete table.', 'With divide and conquer, the best algorithm is the one that minimizes the work, not necessarily the one that balances the input sizes. One lesson to learn from this example is that it can be important to pay attention to what happens for small sizes of n, because any division of the list will eventually produce many small lists. 3We can model all possible divide-and-conquer strategies for this problem with 3the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'If you examine the example Az matrix for n = 8, you should see that there are symmetries within the matrix. For example, the top half is identical to the bottom half with suitable sign changes on some rows and columns. Likewise for the left and right halves. An efﬁcient divide and conquer algorithm exists to perform both the evaluation and the interpolation in Θ(n log n) time. This is called the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It is a recursive function that decomposes the matrix multiplications, taking advantage of the symmetries made available by doing evaluation at the nth roots of unity.

A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'Many data structures are naturally recursive, in that they can be deﬁned as be- ing made up of self-similar parts. Tree structures are an example of this. Thus, the algorithms to manipulate such data structures are often presented recursively. Many searching and sorting algorithms are based on a strategy of divide and con- quer. That is, a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion. Thus, recursion plays an important role throughout this book, and many more examples of recursive functions will be given.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted. In general, a recursive algorithm must have two parts: the base case, which handles a simple input that can be solved without resorting to a recursive call, and the recursive part which contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm where the parameters are in some sense “closer” to the base case than those of the original call.

                Context: ['Dynamic programming is a powerful alternative to the standard principle of divide and conquer. In divide and conquer, a problem is split into subproblems, the subproblems are solved (independently), and then recombined into a solution for the problem being solved. Dynamic programming is appropriate whenever (1) subproblems are solved repeatedly, and (2) we can ﬁnd a suitable way of doing the necessary bookkeeping. Dynamic programming algorithms are usually not imple- mented by simply using a table to store subproblems for recursive calls (i.e., going backwards as is done by fibrt). Instead, such algorithms are typically imple- mented by building the table of subproblems from the bottom up. Thus, fibi bet- ter represents the most common form of dynamic programming than does fibrt, even though it doesn’t use the complete table.', 'With divide and conquer, the best algorithm is the one that minimizes the work, not necessarily the one that balances the input sizes. One lesson to learn from this example is that it can be important to pay attention to what happens for small sizes of n, because any division of the list will eventually produce many small lists. 3We can model all possible divide-and-conquer strategies for this problem with 3the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'If you examine the example Az matrix for n = 8, you should see that there are symmetries within the matrix. For example, the top half is identical to the bottom half with suitable sign changes on some rows and columns. Likewise for the left and right halves. An efﬁcient divide and conquer algorithm exists to perform both the evaluation and the interpolation in Θ(n log n) time. This is called the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It is a recursive function that decomposes the matrix multiplications, taking advantage of the symmetries made available by doing evaluation at the nth roots of unity.

A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'Many data structures are naturally recursive, in that they can be deﬁned as be- ing made up of self-similar parts. Tree structures are an example of this. Thus, the algorithms to manipulate such data structures are often presented recursively. Many searching and sorting algorithms are based on a strategy of divide and con- quer. That is, a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion. Thus, recursion plays an important role throughout this book, and many more examples of recursive functions will be given.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted. In general, a recursive algorithm must have two parts: the base case, which handles a simple input that can be solved without resorting to a recursive call, and the recursive part which contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm where the parameters are in some sense “closer” to the base case than those of the original call.

Dynamic programming algorithms are usually not imple- mented by simply using a table to store subproblems for recursive calls (i.e., going backwards as is done by fibrt). Instead, such algorithms are typically imple- mented by building the table of subproblems from the bottom up. Thus, fibi bet- ter represents the most common form of dynamic programming than does fibrt, even though it doesn’t use the complete table.', 'With divide and conquer, the best algorithm is the one that minimizes the work, not necessarily the one that balances the input sizes. One lesson to learn from this example is that it can be important to pay attention to what happens for small sizes of n, because any division of the list will eventually produce many small lists. 3We can model all possible divide-and-conquer strategies for this problem with 3the following recurrence. 3T(n) = 3\uf8f1 \uf8f2 3\uf8f3', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'If you examine the example Az matrix for n = 8, you should see that there are symmetries within the matrix. For example, the top half is identical to the bottom half with suitable sign changes on some rows and columns. Likewise for the left and right halves. An efﬁcient divide and conquer algorithm exists to perform both the evaluation and the interpolation in Θ(n log n) time. This is called the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). It is a recursive function that decomposes the matrix multiplications, taking advantage of the symmetries made available by doing evaluation at the nth roots of unity. The algorithm is as follows.', 'disk processing, see ﬁle processing divide and conquer, 237, 240, 242, 304, 3467, 472–474 3document retrieval, 314, 335 double buffering, 275, 287, 288 dynamic array, see array, dynamic dynamic memory allocation, 100 dynamic programming, 509–515, 532, 3553 3efﬁciency, xiii, 3–5 element, 23 3homogeneity, 94, 112 3implementation, 111–112', 'Those who are unfamiliar with recursion might ﬁnd it hard to accept that it is used primarily as a tool for simplifying the design and description of algorithms. A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.) If necessary, the clear, recursive solution can later be modiﬁed to yield a faster implementation, as described in Section 4.2.4.', 'Many data structures are naturally recursive, in that they can be deﬁned as be- ing made up of self-similar parts. Tree structures are an example of this. Thus, the algorithms to manipulate such data structures are often presented recursively. Many searching and sorting algorithms are based on a strategy of divide and con- quer. That is, a solution is found by breaking the problem into smaller (similar) subproblems, solving the subproblems, then combining the subproblem solutions to form the solution to the original problem. This process is often implemented using recursion. Thus, recursion plays an important role throughout this book, and many more examples of recursive functions will be given.', 'An algorithm is recursive if it calls itself to do part of its work. For this approach to be successful, the “call to itself” must be on a smaller problem then the one originally attempted. In general, a recursive algorithm must have two parts: the base case, which handles a simple input that can be solved without resorting to a recursive call, and the recursive part which contains one or more recursive calls to the algorithm where the parameters are in some sense “closer” to the base case than those of the original call. Here is a recursive Java function to compute the factorial of n. A trace of fact’s execution for a small value of n is presented in Section 4.2.4.', 'Algorithms: An algorithm is a method or a process followed to solve a problem. If the problem is viewed as a function, then an algorithm is an implementation for the function that transforms an input to the corresponding output. A problem can be solved by many different algorithms. A given algorithm solves only one problem (i.e., computes a particular function). This book covers many problems, and for several of these problems I present more than one algorithm. For the important problem of sorting I present nearly a dozen algorithms!', '3.20 It is possible to change the way that we pick the dividing point in a binary search, and still get a working search routine.

Quicksort is inherently recursive, because each Quicksort operation must sort two sublists. Thus, there is no simple way to turn Quicksort into an iterative algorithm.

We need not store copies of a 3Sec. 7.6 Heapsort', 'The recursive version of the factorial function might seem unnecessarily com- plicated to you because the same effect can be achieved by using a while loop.

This comes as a result of the fact that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. 317.3.1 Uncountability 3Before proving that the Halting Problem is unsolvable, we ﬁrst prove that not all functions can be implemented as a computer program. This must be so because the number of programs is much smaller than the number of possible functions.', 'Sec. 17.3 Impossible Problems 317.3.2 The Halting Problem Is Unsolvable 3While there might be intellectual appeal to knowing that there exists some function that cannot be computed by a computer program, does this mean that there is any such useful function? After all, does it really matter if no program can compute a “nonsense” function such as shown in Bin 4 of Figure 17.7? Now we will prove that the Halting Problem cannot be computed by any computer program. The proof is by contradiction.', 'Turing machines are a simple model of computation for writing programs that are language acceptors. There is a “universal” Turing machine that can take as in- put a description for a Turing machine, and an input string, and return the execution of that machine on that string. This Turing machine in turn can be cast as a Boolean expression such that the expression is satisﬁable if and only if the Turing machine yields ACCEPT for that string. Cook used Turing machines in his proof because they are simple enough that he could develop this transformation of Turing ma- chines to Boolean expressions, but rich enough to be able to compute any function that a regular computer can compute. The signiﬁcance of this transformation is that any decision problem that is performable by the Turing machine is transformable to SAT. Thus, SAT is N P-hard.', '17 Limits to Computation 317.1 Reductions 17.2 Hard Problems 317.2.1 The Theory of N P-Completeness 17.2.2 N P-Completeness Proofs 17.2.3 Coping with N P-Complete Problems 317.3 Impossible Problems 317.3.1 Uncountability 17.3.2 The Halting Problem Is Unsolvable 317.4 Further Reading 17.5 Exercises 17.6 Projects 3Bibliography 3Contents 3501 504 504 507 3509 509 511 513 515 515 516 522 523 523 524 526 527 532 532 533 3535 536 541 543 547 552 555 556 559 561 562 564 3567 3Contents 3Index 3xi 3573', '559 3560 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3that is, it halts. Thus, contrary does the contrary of what halt says that it will do. 3The action of contrary is logically inconsistent with the assumption that halt solves the Halting Problem correctly. There are no other assumptions we made that might cause this inconsistency. Thus, by contradiction, we have proved that halt cannot solve the Halting Problem correctly, and thus there is no program that can solve the Halting Problem.', '17.19 Prove, using a reduction argument such as given in Section 17.3.2, that the problem of determining whether there is some input on which two arbitrary programs will both halt is unsolvable. 317.20 Prove, using a reduction argument such as given in Section 17.3.2, that the problem of determining whether an arbitrary program halts on all inputs is unsolvable.', 'Example 17.5 For arbitrary program P, does there exist any input for which P halts?
