CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9613095238095238 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.96 because most relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. However, the first irrelevant node, ranked 11th, focuses on 'raw comparisons and specific search algorithms, which are not directly related to the expected learning outcomes.' This slightly affects the score, but overall, the relevant nodes are well-ranked, reflecting a strong contextual precision.

REASON: The score is 0.90 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'empirical testing of sorting algorithms,' which is relevant to the learning outcomes, while the seventh node, which is irrelevant, provides 'a general definition of algorithms' and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the tenth node, which is irrelevant, 'discusses examples of algorithm analysis without directly addressing the specific learning outcomes' and should be ranked lower than relevant nodes. However, the presence of some irrelevant nodes ranked relatively high prevents the score from being perfect.

If the problem is viewed as a function, then an algorithm is an implementation for the function that transforms an input to the corresponding output. A problem can be solved by many different algorithms. A given algorithm solves only one problem (i.e., computes a particular function).

Best case? Average case? Or worst case?” Some algorithms have the same behavior no matter which input instance they receive. An example is ﬁnding the maximum in an array of integers. But for many algorithms, it makes a big difference, such as when searching an unsorted array for a particular value. So any statement about the upper bound of an algorithm must be in the context of some class of inputs of size n. We measure this upper bound nearly always on the best-case, average-case, or worst-case inputs. Thus, we cannot say, “this algorithm has an upper bound to its growth rate of n2.” We must say something like, “this algorithm has an upper bound to its growth rate of n2 in the average case.”'].

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT.

Assume that the front element of the queue is initially at position 0, and that elements are added to successively higher-numbered positions in the array. When elements are removed from the queue, the front index increases. Over time, the entire queue will drift toward the higher-numbered positions in the array. Once an element is inserted into the highest-numbered position in the array, the queue has run out of space. This hap- pens despite the fact that there might be free positions at the low end of the array where elements have previously been removed from the queue.', 'Sec. 4.3 Queues 3/** Queue ADT */ public interface Queue<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the queue. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the queue elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Place an element at the rear of the queue. 3@param it The element being enqueued. */ 3public void enqueue(E it); 3/** Remove and return element at the front of the queue. @return The element at the front of the queue. */ 3public E dequeue();', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2.

Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1. Two implementations for the list ADT — the array-based list and the linked list — are covered in detail and their relative merits discussed. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 cover stacks and queues, re- spectively. Sample implementations for each of these data structures are presented.

Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', 'Figure 4.27 shows an array-based queue implementation. listArray holds the queue elements, and as usual, the queue constructor allows an optional param- eter to set the maximum size of the queue.

(We will study how to organize and search through medium amounts of data in Chapters 5, 7, and 9, and discuss how to deal with large amounts of data in Chapters 8–10.) Many applications don’t require any form of search, and they do not require that any or- dering be placed on the objects being stored. Some applications require processing in a strict chronological order, processing objects in the order that they arrived, or perhaps processing objects in the reverse of the order that they arrived.

The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST).

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT.

Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer.

They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'This implementation raises a new problem. Assume that the front element of the queue is initially at position 0, and that elements are added to successively higher-numbered positions in the array. When elements are removed from the queue, the front index increases. Over time, the entire queue will drift toward the higher-numbered positions in the array. Once an element is inserted into the highest-numbered position in the array, the queue has run out of space. This hap- pens despite the fact that there might be free positions at the low end of the array where elements have previously been removed from the queue.', 'Sec. 4.3 Queues 3/** Queue ADT */ public interface Queue<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the queue. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the queue elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Place an element at the rear of the queue. 3@param it The element being enqueued. */ 3public void enqueue(E it); 3/** Remove and return element at the front of the queue. @return The element at the front of the queue. */ 3public E dequeue();', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2.

Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1. Two implementations for the list ADT — the array-based list and the linked list — are covered in detail and their relative merits discussed. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 cover stacks and queues, re- spectively. Sample implementations for each of these data structures are presented.

Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', 'Figure 4.27 shows an array-based queue implementation. listArray holds the queue elements, and as usual, the queue constructor allows an optional param- eter to set the maximum size of the queue. The array as created is actually large enough to hold one element more than the queue will allow, so that empty queues can be distinguished from full queues.

(We will study how to organize and search through medium amounts of data in Chapters 5, 7, and 9, and discuss how to deal with large amounts of data in Chapters 8–10.) Many applications don’t require any form of search, and they do not require that any or- dering be placed on the objects being stored. Some applications require processing in a strict chronological order, processing objects in the order that they arrived, or perhaps processing objects in the reverse of the order that they arrived.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.5936091718533837 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.59 because while some relevant nodes are ranked higher, there are several irrelevant nodes ranked above relevant ones. For instance, the fourth node discusses a 'Java interface for a stack,' which is not directly related to the conceptual understanding of lists, stacks, and queues, yet it is ranked higher than relevant nodes. Similarly, the seventh node talks about a 'problem with queue implementation,' which is not directly related to the conceptual understanding of queues, but is ranked higher than relevant nodes. These instances of irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than relevant ones contribute to the score not being higher.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Recall ---> SCORE: 0.8333333333333334 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.83 because most concepts like lists, stacks, queues, and linked data structures are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, such as nodes 1, 2, 5, and 14. However, the specific mention of 'Linked Lists' is missing, which affects the score.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end.

Assume that the front element of the queue is initially at position 0, and that elements are added to successively higher-numbered positions in the array. When elements are removed from the queue, the front index increases. Over time, the entire queue will drift toward the higher-numbered positions in the array. Once an element is inserted into the highest-numbered position in the array, the queue has run out of space.

Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case.

Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1.

Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure.

A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', 'Figure 4.27 shows an array-based queue implementation. listArray holds the queue elements, and as usual, the queue constructor allows an optional param- eter to set the maximum size of the queue.

(We will study how to organize and search through medium amounts of data in Chapters 5, 7, and 9, and discuss how to deal with large amounts of data in Chapters 8–10.) Many applications don’t require any form of search, and they do not require that any or- dering be placed on the objects being stored.

The array as created is actually large enough to hold one element more than the queue will allow, so that empty queues can be distinguished from full queues.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.4579365079365079 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.46 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the second node discussing 'a general tree class implementation' and the fourth node on 'full and complete 3-ary trees,' are ranked lower than some irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node, which is about 'binary tree traversals and a theorem related to binary trees,' is ranked higher despite not being relevant to non-binary trees. This misranking of relevant and irrelevant nodes affects the score.

The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end).

However, here’s the catch: The input is a stack (not an array), and the only variables that your algorithm may use are a ﬁxed number of integers and a ﬁxed number of stacks. The algorithm should return a stack containing the records in sorted order (with the least value being at the top of the stack). Your algorithm should be Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order.

As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2).

REASON: The score is 0.75 because the nodes in the retrieval context support understanding and implementation of sorting algorithms, as well as empirical comparison, but they do not explicitly mention the divide-and-conquer technique.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', '257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 37.2 Write an Insertion Sort algorithm for integer key values. However, here’s the catch: The input is a stack (not an array), and the only variables that your algorithm may use are a ﬁxed number of integers and a ﬁxed number of stacks. The algorithm should return a stack containing the records in sorted order (with the least value being at the top of the stack). Your algorithm should be Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'In your previous study of computer science, you have probably seen an example of a sorting algorithm whose running time is in O(n2) in the worst case. The simple Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms typically given as examples in a ﬁrst year programming course have worst case running times in O(n2). Thus, the problem of sorting can be said to have an upper bound in O(n2). How do we close the gap between Ω(n) and O(n2)? Can there be a better sorting algorithm? If you can think of no algorithm whose worst-case growth rate is better than O(n2), and if you have discovered no analysis technique to show that the least cost for the problem of sorting in the worst case is greater than Ω(n), then you cannot know for sure whether or not there is a better algorithm.', 'Let us assume for the moment that Y is less than X and so the left branch is taken. In this case, Insertion Sort swaps the two values.

For each one, describe either why it is or is not stable. If a minor change to the implemen- tation would make it stable, describe the change.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases. The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', 'When comparing two sorting algorithms, the most straightforward approach would seem to be simply program both and measure their running times.

REASON: None

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for.

This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key.

Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted.

However, some irrelevant nodes, like the third node ('The context focuses on database indexing and does not directly relate to the expected learning outcomes'), are ranked higher than they should be, which prevents the score from being higher.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer.

This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', 'Example 1.2 A company is developing a database system containing in- formation about cities and towns in the United States.

Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1.

REASON: The actual output covers graph terminology, types of graph representations, and graph traversal algorithms, aligning partially with the expected output. However, it lacks mention of Dijkstra's algorithm and Minimum Spanning Trees, which are present in the expected output. Additionally, the actual output includes extra details like proving properties of trees and topological sorting, which are not required in the expected output.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element.

REASON: The actual output focuses on specific technical details of lists and arrays, while the expected output is more general, focusing on understanding concepts like memory management and allocation. There is a significant discrepancy in the level of detail and focus between the actual and expected outputs.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list.

Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access.

Normally, the size of a node in the B-tree is chosen to ﬁll a disk block. A B-tree node implementation typically allows 100 or more children. Thus, a B-tree node is equivalent to a disk block, and a “pointer” value stored in the tree is actually the number of the block containing the child node (usually interpreted as an offset from the beginning of the corresponding disk ﬁle). In a typical application, the B-tree’s access to the disk ﬁle will be managed using a buffer pool and a block-replacement scheme such as LRU (see Section 8.3).', 'This chapter introduces several tree structures designed for use in specialized ap- plications. The trie of Section 13.1 is commonly used to store and retrieve strings. It also serves to illustrate the concept of a key space decomposition. The AVL tree and splay tree of Section 13.2 are variants on the BST.

For example, an alphabet trie storing the common words in the English language would have many words in the “th” branch of the tree, but none in the “zq” branch. Any multiway branching trie can be replaced with a binary trie by replacing the original trie’s alphabet with an equivalent binary code.

Internal nodes store only the position within the key’s bit pattern that is used to decide on the next branching point. In this way, internal nodes with single children (equivalently, bit positions within the key that do not distinguish any of the keys within the current subtree) are eliminated.

The BST, heap, and Huffman coding tree each have distinctive structural features that affect their implementation and use.', '453 3454 3Chap. 13 Advanced Tree Structures 3data structure for storing such data is the R-tree, which was originally proposed by Guttman [Gut84]. 313.5 Exercises 313.1 Show the binary trie (as illustrated by Figure 13.1) for the following collec- 3tion of values: 42, 12, 100, 10, 50, 31, 7, 11, 99. 313.2 Show the PAT trie (as illustrated by Figure 13.3) for the following collection 3of values: 42, 12, 100, 10, 50, 31, 7, 11, 99.', '5.8 Write a recursive function that returns the height of a binary tree. 5.9 Write a recursive function that returns a count of the number of leaf nodes in 3a binary tree. 35.10 Assume that a given binary tree stores integer values in its nodes. Write a 3recursive function that sums the values of all nodes in the tree.', 'Splitting based on predetermined subdivisions of the key range is called key space decomposition. In computer graphics, the technique is known as image space decomposition, and this term is sometimes used to describe the process for data structures as well. A data structure based on key space decomposition is called a trie. Folklore has it that “trie” comes from “retrieval.” Unfortunately, that would imply that the word is pronounced “tree,” which would lead to confusion with reg- ular use of the word “tree.” “Trie” is actually pronounced as “try.”', '147 3148 3Chap. 5 Binary Trees 3internal nodesAny number of 3Figure 5.4 A tree containing many internal nodes and a single leaf.', '163 3164 3Chap. 5 Binary Trees 372324240120742(a)3742(b)2412042242323740 3Figure 5.13 Two Binary Search Trees for a collection of values.

Tree (b) results if the same values are inserted in the order 120, 42, 42, 7, 2, 32, 37, 24, 40. 3key value K is found, or we reach a leaf node. If we reach a leaf node without encountering K, then no record exists in the BST whose key value is K.', 'The Huffman coding tree of Section 5.6 is another example of a binary trie. All data values in the Huffman tree are at the leaves, and each branch splits the range of possible letter codes in half. The Huffman codes are actually reconstructed from the letter positions within the trie.', 'Proof 1: Take an arbitrary binary tree T and replace every empty subtree with a leaf node. Call the new tree T(cid:48). All nodes originally in T will be internal nodes in T(cid:48) (because even the leaf nodes of T have children in T(cid:48)). T(cid:48) is a full binary tree, because every internal node of T now must have two children in T(cid:48), and each leaf node in T must have two children in T(cid:48) (the leaves just added). The Full Binary Tree Theorem tells us that the number of leaves in a full binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes. Thus, the number of new leaves that were added to create T(cid:48) is one more than the number of nodes in T. Each leaf node in T(cid:48) corresponds to an empty subtree in T. Thus, the number of empty subtrees in T is one more than (cid:50) the number of nodes in T.'].

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.4648148148148148 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.46 because relevant nodes, such as the third node discussing 'amortized analysis', the fifth node on 'asymptotic analysis', and the sixth node on 'analyzing problems and determining upper and lower bounds', are interspersed with irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node, which is about 'abstract data types and data structures', and the second node, which mentions 'tuning algorithms and empirical analysis', are ranked higher than some relevant nodes.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.08333333333333333 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.08 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which explicitly mentions 'Dynamic Programming' and 'Randomized Algorithms', is ranked 12th. This is much lower than many irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'implementing and timing search algorithms', which is not directly related to the expected learning outcomes. The presence of many irrelevant nodes ranked higher than the relevant one significantly lowers the score.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9649678604224058 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.96 because most relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first seven nodes in the retrieval context are relevant, discussing topics like 'Reductions', 'The Theory of N P-Completeness', and the 'Halting Problem', which are crucial for understanding the learning outcomes. However, the eighth node is irrelevant as it is a 'bibliography entry' and should be ranked lower. Despite this, the high score reflects that the majority of relevant information is prioritized effectively.
