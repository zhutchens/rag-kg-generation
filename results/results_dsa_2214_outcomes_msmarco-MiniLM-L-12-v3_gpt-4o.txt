Instead of an improvement by a factor of ten, the improvement is only the square 361 362 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3√', '7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'Given an algebraic equation describing the time requirement for an algorithm, the upper and lower bounds always meet. That is because in some sense we have a perfect analysis for the algorithm, embodied by the running-time equation. For many algorithms (or their instantiations as programs), it is easy to come up with the equation that deﬁnes their runtime behavior. Most algorithms presented in this book are well understood and we can almost always give a Θ analysis for them. However, Chapter 17 discusses a whole class of algorithms for which we have no Θ analysis, just some unsatisfying big-Oh and Ω analyses. Exercise 3.14 presents a short, simple program fragment for which nobody currently knows the true upper or lower bounds.', '3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3Big-Oh notation describes an upper bound. In other words, big-Oh notation states a claim about the greatest amount of some resource (usually time) that is required by an algorithm for some class of inputs of size n (typically the worst such input, the average of all possible inputs, or the best such input).', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'This book describes data structures that can be used in a wide variety of problems, and many examples of efﬁcient algorithms. In general, our search algorithms strive to be at worst in O(log n) to ﬁnd a record, and our sorting algorithms strive to be in O(n log n). A few algorithms have higher asymptotic complexity. Both Floyd’s all-pairs shortest-paths algorithm and standard matrix multiply have running times of Θ(n3) (though for both, the amount of data being processed is Θ(n2)).', 'This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and fundamental tech- niques of algorithm analysis. We focus on a methodology known as asymptotic algorithm analysis, or simply asymptotic analysis. Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource consumption of an algorithm. It allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more algorithms for solving the same problem. Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource constraints for a problem before they imple- ment an actual program. After reading this chapter, you should understand', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', 'So far all of our examples of algorithm analysis give “obvious” results, with big-Oh always matching Ω. To understand how big-Oh, Ω, and Θ notations are properly used to describe our understanding of a problem or an algorithm, it is best to consider an example where you do not already know a lot about the problem.', 'Pioneering works on algorithm analysis include The Art of Computer Programming by Donald E. Knuth [Knu97, Knu98], and The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman [AHU74]. The alternate deﬁnition for Ω comes from [AHU83]. The use of the notation “T(n) is in O(f (n))” rather than the more commonly used “T(n) = O(f (n))” I derive from Brassard and Bratley [BB96], though certainly this use predates them. A good book to read for further information on algorithm analysis techniques is Compared to What? by Gregory J.E. Rawlins [Raw92].', 'Similar notation is used to describe the least amount of a resource that an alg- orithm needs for some class of input. Like big-Oh notation, this is a measure of the algorithm’s growth rate. Like big-Oh notation, it works for any resource, but we most often measure the least amount of time required. And again, like big-Oh no- tation, we are measuring the resource required for some particular class of inputs: the worst-, average-, or best-case input of size n.', 'Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction 33 Algorithm Analysis 33.1 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 3.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm? 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 3Introduction 33.4.1 Upper Bounds 3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3.4.3 Θ Notation 3.4.4 3.4.5 Classifying Functions 3Simplifying Rules', 'While some textbooks and programmers will casually say that an algorithm is “order of” or “big-Oh” of some cost function, it is generally better to use Θ notation rather than big-Oh notation whenever we have sufﬁcient knowledge about an alg- orithm to be sure that the upper and lower bounds indeed match. Throughout this book, Θ notation will be used in preference to big-Oh notation whenever our state of knowledge makes that possible. Limitations on our ability to analyze certain algorithms may require use of big-Oh or Ω notations. In rare occasions when the discussion is explicitly about the upper or lower bound of a problem or algorithm, the corresponding notation will be used in preference to Θ notation.', '16 Patterns of Algorithms 316.1 Dynamic Programming 316.1.1 The Knapsack Problem 16.1.2 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 316.2 Randomized Algorithms 316.2.1 Randomized algorithms for ﬁnding large values 16.2.2 Skip Lists 16.3 Numerical Algorithms 16.3.1 Exponentiation 16.3.2 Largest Common Factor 16.3.3 Matrix Multiplication 16.3.4 Random Numbers 16.3.5 The Fast Fourier Transform 316.4 Further Reading 16.5 Exercises 16.6 Projects 317 Limits to Computation 317.1 Reductions 17.2 Hard Problems', '1.

REASON: The score is 0.95 because most relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'the impact of algorithm growth rates,' which is relevant, while the tenth node, which is irrelevant, provides 'historical references and further reading' and is ranked lower. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, like the twelfth node that 'lists various topics,' are ranked above relevant nodes, such as the thirteenth node discussing 'the use of Θ notation.'

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists, Stacks, and Queues. The relevant context can be found here: ['Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1. Two implementations for the list ADT — the array-based list and the linked list — are covered in detail and their relative merits discussed. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 cover stacks and queues, re- spectively. Sample implementations for each of these data structures are presented. Section 4.4 presents the Dictionary ADT for storing and retrieving data, which sets a context for implementing search structures such as the Binary Search Tree of Section 5.4.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'Assume that there are n elements in the queue. By analogy to the array-based list implementation, we could require that all elements of the queue be stored in the ﬁrst n positions of the array.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 1.0 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. The first five nodes in the retrieval context provide essential information on the FIFO principle of queues, the LIFO principle of stacks, and linked lists, which are directly relevant to the input. The irrelevant nodes, such as the sixth node discussing 'specific implementation details for a stack ADT' and the seventh node on 'time complexity of queue operations', are ranked lower, ensuring a perfect contextual precision score. Great job on maintaining relevance!

REASON: The score is 0.77 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. For example, the first node provides 'definitions and properties of full and complete binary trees,' which is fundamental to understanding binary trees, while the fourth node, which is ranked lower, focuses on 'threaded binary trees,' a specific implementation detail not directly related to the general learning outcomes. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the fifth node that 'illustrates differences between full and complete binary trees but does not directly contribute to the broader learning outcomes,' are ranked relatively high.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.23832070707070707 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.24 because relevant nodes discussing 'non-binary trees' and 'K-ary trees' are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node in the retrieval context is about 'binary trees, which are not directly relevant to non-binary trees', while the eighth node, which is relevant as it 'mentions non-binary trees and their representations', is ranked lower. Similarly, the eleventh node, which 'introduces K-ary trees, a type of non-binary tree', is also ranked lower than several irrelevant nodes.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Non-Binary Trees. The relevant context can be found here: ['Two restricted forms of binary tree are sufﬁciently important to warrant special names. Each node in a full binary tree is either (1) an internal node with exactly two non-empty children or (2) a leaf. A complete binary tree has a restricted shape obtained by starting at the root and ﬁlling the tree by levels from left to right. In the complete binary tree of height d, all levels except possibly level d−1 are completely full. The bottom level has its nodes ﬁlled in from the left side.', 'Sec. 5.2 Binary Tree Traversals 3Theorem 5.2 The number of empty subtrees in a non-empty binary tree is one more than the number of nodes in the tree.', 'Note that this representation for serializing general trees cannot be used for bi- nary trees. This is because a binary tree is not merely a restricted form of general tree with at most two children. Every binary tree node has a left and a right child, though either or both might be empty. For example, the representation of Exam- ple 6.8 cannot let us distinguish whether node D in Figure 6.17 is the left or right child of node B. 36.6 Further Reading', 'The previous section points out that a large fraction of the space in a typical binary tree node implementation is devoted to structural overhead, not to storing data. This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage. Assume that we have R runs to merge. If a simple two-way merge is used, then R runs (regardless of their sizes) will require log R passes through 3Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3InputMemoryOutput1612291614192125295631143525312140295621405640212531291612564031251921252156314019191921253156402914', 'While Ω(n log n) is the theoretical lower bound in the worst case for sorting, many times the input is sufﬁciently well ordered that certain algorithms can take advantage of this fact to speed the sorting process. A simple example is Insertion Sort’s best-case running time. Sorting algorithms whose running time is based on the amount of disorder in the input are called adaptive. For more information on adaptive sorting algorithms, see “A Survey of Adaptive Sorting Algorithms” by Estivill-Castro and Wood [ECW92].', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array. If the pivot values are selected at random, then this is extremely unlikely to happen. When selecting the middle position of the current subarray, it 32The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records.

We can expect this to occur for about half the comparisons in the average case, leading to Θ(n2) for the expected number of swaps.

The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

Would the change affect the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm? How would the change affect the running time of the algorithm?', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', '8.5.1 Simple Approaches to External Sorting', 'that can handle n airplanes quickly enough most of the time, but which fails to perform quickly enough when all n airplanes are coming from the same direction. For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'It is a common mistake to confuse the concepts of upper bound or lower bound on the one hand, and worst case or best case on the other. The best, worst, or average cases each give us a concrete input instance (or concrete set of instances) that we can apply to an algorithm description to get a cost measure. The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure. So to deﬁne the growth rate for an algorithm or problem, we need to determine what we are measuring (the best, worst, or average case) and also our description for what we know about the growth rate of that cost measure (big-Oh, Ω, or Θ).', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage. Assume that we have R runs to merge. If a simple two-way merge is used, then R runs (regardless of their sizes) will require log R passes through 3Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3InputMemoryOutput1612291614192125295631143525312140295621405640212531291612564031251921252156314019191921253156402914', 'While Ω(n log n) is the theoretical lower bound in the worst case for sorting, many times the input is sufﬁciently well ordered that certain algorithms can take advantage of this fact to speed the sorting process. A simple example is Insertion Sort’s best-case running time. Sorting algorithms whose running time is based on the amount of disorder in the input are called adaptive. For more information on adaptive sorting algorithms, see “A Survey of Adaptive Sorting Algorithms” by Estivill-Castro and Wood [ECW92].', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array. If the pivot values are selected at random, then this is extremely unlikely to happen.

These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records.

We can expect this to occur for about half the comparisons in the average case, leading to Θ(n2) for the expected number of swaps. The actual number of swaps performed by Bubble Sort will be identical to that performed by Insertion Sort.', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

Would the change affect the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm? How would the change affect the running time of the algorithm?', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', '8.5.1 Simple Approaches to External Sorting', 'that can handle n airplanes quickly enough most of the time, but which fails to perform quickly enough when all n airplanes are coming from the same direction. For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'It is a common mistake to confuse the concepts of upper bound or lower bound on the one hand, and worst case or best case on the other. The best, worst, or average cases each give us a concrete input instance (or concrete set of instances) that we can apply to an algorithm description to get a cost measure. The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure. So to deﬁne the growth rate for an algorithm or problem, we need to determine what we are measuring (the best, worst, or average case) and also our description for what we know about the growth rate of that cost measure (big-Oh, Ω, or Θ).', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case.

Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2).

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition.

However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight.

The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort.

For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure.

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.5373505345231445 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.54 because several relevant nodes about sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort and Quicksort, are ranked higher. However, the score is not higher because irrelevant nodes, like those discussing 'external sorting' in the first node and 'external sorting efficiency' in the second node, are ranked above relevant nodes, which affects the precision.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array.

Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case.

Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L.

Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2).

To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory.

REASON: The score is 0.50 because only two out of four sentences in the expected output are supported by nodes in the retrieval context. Specifically, sentence 3 is supported by node 7, and sentence 4 is supported by node 19, while sentences 1 and 2 lack direct support from any nodes in the retrieval context.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early.

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case.

In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers. In the average and worst cases this algorithm is in Ω(n), because in both the average and worst cases we must examine at least cn values (where c is 1/2 in the average case and 1 in the worst case). 33.4.3 Θ Notation', 'It is a common mistake to confuse the concepts of upper bound or lower bound on the one hand, and worst case or best case on the other. The best, worst, or average cases each give us a concrete input instance (or concrete set of instances) that we can apply to an algorithm description to get a cost measure. The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure. So to deﬁne the growth rate for an algorithm or problem, we need to determine what we are measuring (the best, worst, or average case) and also our description for what we know about the growth rate of that cost measure (big-Oh, Ω, or Θ).', '3.22 Can the average case cost for an algorithm be worse than the worst case cost? 3Can it be better than the best case cost?

It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', 'How big a ﬁle can be merged in one pass? Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm. Otherwise, we often desire an average-case analysis if we know enough about the distribution of our input to compute the average case. If not, then we must resort to worst-case analysis. 33.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm?', 'Let us look ahead to analyzing the problem of sorting to see how this process works. What is the least possible cost for any sorting algorithm in the worst case? The algorithm must at least look at every element in the input, just to determine that the input is truly sorted. Thus, any sorting algorithm must take at least cn time. For many problems, this observation that each of the n inputs must be looked at leads to an easy Ω(n) lower bound.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved.

In fact, a poor sorting algorithm might have an arbitrarily large number of nodes in its decision tree, with leaves of arbitrary depth. There is no limit to how slow the “worst” possible sort- ing algorithm could be. However, we are interested here in knowing what the best sorting algorithm could have as its minimum cost in the worst case.

But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good.

REASON: None

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Note however that the running time for sequential search will be roughly the same regardless of whether or not the array values are stored in order. In contrast, binary search requires that the array values be ordered from lowest to highest. De- pending on the context in which binary search is to be used, this requirement for a sorted array could be detrimental to the running time of a complete program, be- cause maintaining the values in sorted order requires to greater cost when inserting new elements into the array.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database.

When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Note however that the running time for sequential search will be roughly the same regardless of whether or not the array values are stored in order. In contrast, binary search requires that the array values be ordered from lowest to highest.

We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost.

Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9536042240587694 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.95 because most relevant nodes discussing search algorithms and their implementations are ranked higher. However, the score is not higher because the seventh node, which discusses 'merge insert sort', is ranked above some relevant nodes. Additionally, the thirteenth node, which talks about 'jump search and recursion', and the fourteenth node, which compares 'binary search and QBS', are also ranked higher than they should be, as they are not directly related to the expected learning outcomes.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: ['If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: ['A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented.

REASON: The score is 1.00 because there are no contradictions, indicating perfect alignment between the actual output and the retrieval context. Great job!

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: ['A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5.

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. The first five nodes provide detailed information on primary and secondary keys, linear indexing, various indexing methods, and tree-based indexing, which are directly related to the learning outcomes. The irrelevant nodes, starting from the sixth node, include vague contexts, figure descriptions, and topics unrelated to indexing, such as UNION/FIND operations and algorithm analysis, ensuring they are ranked lower.

REASON: The score is 0.92 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node explains 'graph terminology', which is relevant, while the sixth node, which focuses on 'proving properties of graphs and trees', is not directly related to the expected learning outcomes and is ranked lower. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, like the tenth node about 'algorithms for determining bipartite graphs', are ranked above relevant nodes, such as the thirteenth node discussing 'implementing functions for reading and writing graphs'.

In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data type and its physical implementation in a computer program. For example, there are two tra- ditional implementations for the list data type: the linked list and the array-based list. The list data type can therefore be implemented using a linked list or an ar- ray. Even the term “array” is ambiguous in that it can refer either to a data type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each memory location stores one ﬁxed-length data item. By this meaning, an array is a physical data structure. However, array can also mean a logical data type composed of a (typically ho- mogeneous) collection of data items, with each data item identiﬁed by an index It is possible to implement arrays in many different ways.

On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted.

If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element.

REASON: The score is 0.94 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first four nodes are relevant as they discuss 'how elements are stored and accessed in an array-based list', 'space efficiency of array-based lists versus linked lists', 'efficiency of stack operations in array-based implementations', and 'distinguishes between data types and their implementations', which are all pertinent to understanding advanced list structures and memory management. However, the fifth node, which is irrelevant as it 'focuses on insertion and search times in unsorted and sorted lists', is ranked higher than some relevant nodes, preventing a perfect score.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lists and Arrays Revisited. The relevant context can be found here: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data type and its physical implementation in a computer program. For example, there are two tra- ditional implementations for the list data type: the linked list and the array-based list. The list data type can therefore be implemented using a linked list or an ar- ray. Even the term “array” is ambiguous in that it can refer either to a data type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each memory location stores one ﬁxed-length data item. By this meaning, an array is a physical data structure. However, array can also mean a logical data type composed of a (typically ho- mogeneous) collection of data items, with each data item identiﬁed by an index It is possible to implement arrays in many different ways. For exam- number.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.837202380952381 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.84 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant ones. For example, the first node discusses 'splay tree and AVL tree rotations', which is relevant, while the fifth node, which is less relevant as it 'discusses B-trees and disk block management', is ranked lower. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the sixth node that 'is a reference for further reading on AVL and splay trees', are ranked relatively high, affecting the overall precision.

REASON: The score is 0.41 because relevant nodes discussing 'amortized analysis', 'asymptotic analysis', and 'estimating upper and lower bounds' are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'abstract data types and data structures', which is not directly related to algorithm analysis techniques, and should be ranked lower than the fifth node, which introduces 'amortized analysis', a relevant technique. Similarly, the second node mentions 'tuning algorithms and empirical analysis', which does not directly address algorithm analysis techniques, and should be ranked lower than the sixth node, which mentions 'asymptotic analysis', a key concept in algorithm analysis.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lower Bounds. The relevant context can be found here: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'The beneﬁts of being able to discover a strong lower bound are signiﬁcant. In particular, when we can make the upper and lower bounds for a problem meet, this means that we truly understand our problem in a theoretical sense. It also saves us the effort of attempting to discover more (asymptotically) efﬁcient algorithms when no such algorithm can exist.', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'This book contains many analyses for algorithms. These analyses generally deﬁne the upper and lower bounds for algorithms in their worst and average cases. For many of the algorithms presented so far, analysis has been easy. This section con- siders a more difﬁcult task — an analysis for the cost of a problem as opposed to an algorithm. The upper bound for a problem can be deﬁned as the asymptotic cost of the fastest known algorithm. The lower bound deﬁnes the best possible efﬁciency for any algorithm that solves the problem, including algorithms not yet invented. Once the upper and lower bounds for the problem meet, we know that no future algorithm can possibly be (asymptotically) more efﬁcient.', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'Given this deﬁnition for searching, we can easily come up with the standard sequential search algorithm, and we can also see that the lower bound for this prob- lem is “obviously” n comparisons.

QUERY: Identify the 10 most important learning outcomes for chapter Lower Bounds. The relevant context can be found here: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.7993371212121213 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.80 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'the distinction between upper and lower bounds,' which is essential for understanding algorithm lower bounds, while the fourth node, which is irrelevant, discusses 'reductions and limits to computation,' not directly related to the expected learning outcomes. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the sixth node discussing 'when to stop looking for better algorithms,' are ranked above relevant nodes like the eighth node, which highlights 'the significance of discovering strong lower bounds.'

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 1.0 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 1.00 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are perfectly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first node discusses 'dynamic programming, which is directly relevant' to the input, and the second node lists 'various algorithmic topics, including dynamic programming and randomized algorithms, which align with the expected learning outcomes.' All irrelevant nodes, such as the third node focusing on 'Strassen’s algorithm and its complexity, which is not directly related,' are ranked lower, ensuring perfect precision. Great job on achieving a perfect score!

Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', 'This chapter presents a brief introduction to the theory of expensive and im- possible problems.

Section 17.2 discusses “hard” problems, by which we mean prob- lems that require, or at least appear to require, time exponential on the input size. Finally, Section 17.3 considers various problems that, while often simple to deﬁne and comprehend, are in fact impossible to solve using a computer program.

Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', 'This chapter presents a brief introduction to the theory of expensive and im- possible problems. Section 17.1 presents the concept of a reduction, which is the central tool used for analyzing the difﬁculty of a problem (as opposed to analyzing the cost of an algorithm). Reductions allow us to relate the difﬁculty of various problems, which is often much easier than doing the analysis for a problem from ﬁrst principles. Section 17.2 discusses “hard” problems, by which we mean prob- lems that require, or at least appear to require, time exponential on the input size. Finally, Section 17.3 considers various problems that, while often simple to deﬁne and comprehend, are in fact impossible to solve using a computer program. The classic example of such a problem is deciding whether an arbitrary computer pro- gram will go into an inﬁnite loop when processing a speciﬁed input.

It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', 'This chapter presents a brief introduction to the theory of expensive and im- possible problems.

REASON: The score is 0.97 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses '17.1 Reductions' and '17.2 Hard Problems', which are relevant to the input, while the ninth node, which is irrelevant, discusses 'hashing' and 'collision resolution', not directly related to limits of computation. Similarly, the sixteenth node, which is irrelevant, discusses 'problems, algorithms, and programs', and is ranked lower than relevant nodes. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the ninth node, are still ranked relatively high in the list.

Figure 3.3 shows how large a problem can be solved on the two machines for ﬁve of the running-time functions from Figure 3.1.', 'The claim that all modern programming languages can implement the same algorithms (stated more precisely, any function that is computable by one program- ming language is computable by any programming language with certain standard capabilities) is a key result from computability theory. For an easy introduction to this ﬁeld see James L. Hein, Discrete Structures, Logic, and Computability [Hei09]. Much of computer science is devoted to problem solving. Indeed, this is what attracts many people to the ﬁeld. How to Solve It by George P´olya [P´ol57] is con- sidered to be the classic work on how to improve your problem-solving abilities. If you want to be a better student (as well as a better problem solver in general), see Strategies for Creative Problem Solving by Folger and LeBlanc [FL95], Effective Problem Solving by Marvin Levine [Lev94], and Problem Solving & Comprehen- sion by Arthur Whimbey and Jack Lochhead [WL99], and Puzzle-Based Learning by Zbigniew and Matthew Michaelewicz [MM08].', 'This proof is wrong. It exhibits the necessity fallacy: “Our algorithm does 3something, therefore all algorithms solving the problem must do the same.”'].
