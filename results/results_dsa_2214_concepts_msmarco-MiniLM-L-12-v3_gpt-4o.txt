CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9357278016101547 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.94 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'ADTs, lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees', which are highly relevant to the input. However, the ninth node, which is about 'implementing and timing binary search algorithms', is not directly related to the expected output and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the twelfth node, which covers 'buffers, buffer pools, and external sorting', is not directly related and should also be ranked lower. Despite these few misplacements, the overall ranking is strong, leading to a high score.

Sections 5.4 through 5.6 present three examples of binary trees used in speciﬁc applications: the Binary Search Tree (BST) for implementing dictionaries, heaps for implementing priority queues, and Huffman coding trees for text compression. The BST, heap, and Huffman coding tree each have distinctive structural features that affect their implementation and use.', 'Our second graph traversal algorithm is known as a breadth-ﬁrst search (BFS). BFS examines all vertices connected to the start vertex before visiting vertices fur- ther away. BFS is implemented similarly to DFS, except that a queue replaces the recursion stack. Note that if the graph is a tree and the start vertex is at the root, BFS is equivalent to visiting vertices level by level from top to bottom. Fig- ure 11.10 provides an implementation for the BFS algorithm. Figure 11.11 shows a graph and the corresponding breadth-ﬁrst search tree.

Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.16666666666666666 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.17 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which discusses 'relations and partial ordering', is ranked sixth. This node is related to the concept of sets and relations in the expected output. However, irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'random number generation and LCM', and the second node about 'integer functions', are ranked higher, which lowers the score.

Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', 'Given an algebraic equation describing the time requirement for an algorithm, the upper and lower bounds always meet. That is because in some sense we have a perfect analysis for the algorithm, embodied by the running-time equation. For many algorithms (or their instantiations as programs), it is easy to come up with the equation that deﬁnes their runtime behavior.

The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis.

We will always assume T(n) is a non-negative value.', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', 'Given an algebraic equation describing the time requirement for an algorithm, the upper and lower bounds always meet. That is because in some sense we have a perfect analysis for the algorithm, embodied by the running-time equation. For many algorithms (or their instantiations as programs), it is easy to come up with the equation that deﬁnes their runtime behavior. Most algorithms presented in this book are well understood and we can almost always give a Θ analysis for them. However, Chapter 17 discusses a whole class of algorithms for which we have no Θ analysis, just some unsatisfying big-Oh and Ω analyses. Exercise 3.14 presents a short, simple program fragment for which nobody currently knows the true upper or lower bounds.', 'An algorithm with time equation T(n) = 2n2 does not receive nearly as great an improvement from the faster machine as an algorithm with linear growth rate. Instead of an improvement by a factor of ten, the improvement is only the square 361 362 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3√', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', 'This book describes data structures that can be used in a wide variety of problems, and many examples of efﬁcient algorithms. In general, our search algorithms strive to be at worst in O(log n) to ﬁnd a record, and our sorting algorithms strive to be in O(n log n). A few algorithms have higher asymptotic complexity.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements.

By analogy to the array-based list implementation, we could require that all elements of the queue be stored in the ﬁrst n positions of the array. If we choose the rear element of the queue to be in position 0, then dequeue operations require only Θ(1) time because the front ele- ment of the queue (the one being removed) is the last element in the array. However, enqueue operations will require Θ(n) time, because the n elements currently in the queue must each be shifted one position in the array. If instead we chose the rear element of the queue to be in position n − 1, then an enqueue operation is equivalent to an append operation on a list. This requires only Θ(1) time. But now, a dequeue operation requires Θ(n) time, because all of the elements must be shifted down by one position to retain the property that the remaining n − 1 queue elements reside in the ﬁrst n − 1 positions of the array.', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons. Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1. Two implementations for the list ADT — the array-based list and the linked list — are covered in detail and their relative merits discussed. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 cover stacks and queues, re- spectively. Sample implementations for each of these data structures are presented.

Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', 'Figure 4.27 shows an array-based queue implementation. listArray holds the queue elements, and as usual, the queue constructor allows an optional param- eter to set the maximum size of the queue. The array as created is actually large enough to hold one element more than the queue will allow, so that empty queues can be distinguished from full queues.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements.

Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer.

By analogy to the array-based list implementation, we could require that all elements of the queue be stored in the ﬁrst n positions of the array. If we choose the rear element of the queue to be in position 0, then dequeue operations require only Θ(1) time because the front ele- ment of the queue (the one being removed) is the last element in the array. However, enqueue operations will require Θ(n) time, because the n elements currently in the queue must each be shifted one position in the array. If instead we chose the rear element of the queue to be in position n − 1, then an enqueue operation is equivalent to an append operation on a list. This requires only Θ(1) time. But now, a dequeue operation requires Θ(n) time, because all of the elements must be shifted down by one position to retain the property that the remaining n − 1 queue elements reside in the ﬁrst n − 1 positions of the array.', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2. Element 3 will be inserted into a list of size three, costing two comparisons. Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1. Two implementations for the list ADT — the array-based list and the linked list — are covered in detail and their relative merits discussed. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 cover stacks and queues, re- spectively. Sample implementations for each of these data structures are presented.

Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', 'Figure 4.27 shows an array-based queue implementation. listArray holds the queue elements, and as usual, the queue constructor allows an optional param- eter to set the maximum size of the queue. The array as created is actually large enough to hold one element more than the queue will allow, so that empty queues can be distinguished from full queues. Member maxSize is used to control the circular motion of the queue (it is the base for the modulus operator). Member rear is set to the position of the current rear element, while front is the position of the current front element.', 'T(n) = T((cid:100)n/2(cid:101)) + T((cid:98)n/2(cid:99)) + n; T(1) = 1. 3Then, rewrite your algorithm to simulate the recursive calls with a stack. 4.18 Let Q be a non-empty queue, and let S be an empty stack.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.7496185246874494 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.75 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'stacks as a list-like structure and mentions freelists', which is relevant, while the ninth node, which is irrelevant, discusses 'a poset and element insertion'. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the eleventh node discussing 'Java ADT for a queue and recursive algorithms', are ranked higher than other relevant nodes.

By analogy to the array-based list implementation, we could require that all elements of the queue be stored in the ﬁrst n positions of the array. If we choose the rear element of the queue to be in position 0, then dequeue operations require only Θ(1) time because the front ele- ment of the queue (the one being removed) is the last element in the array. However, enqueue operations will require Θ(n) time, because the n elements currently in the queue must each be shifted one position in the array. If instead we chose the rear element of the queue to be in position n − 1, then an enqueue operation is equivalent to an append operation on a list. This requires only Θ(1) time.

Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1.

However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST).

By analogy to the array-based list implementation, we could require that all elements of the queue be stored in the ﬁrst n positions of the array. If we choose the rear element of the queue to be in position 0, then dequeue operations require only Θ(1) time because the front ele- ment of the queue (the one being removed) is the last element in the array. However, enqueue operations will require Θ(n) time, because the n elements currently in the queue must each be shifted one position in the array. If instead we chose the rear element of the queue to be in position n − 1, then an enqueue operation is equivalent to an append operation on a list. This requires only Θ(1) time. But now, a dequeue operation requires Θ(n) time, because all of the elements must be shifted down by one position to retain the property that the remaining n − 1 queue elements reside in the ﬁrst n − 1 positions of the array.', 'For ten elements, given the poset shown in Figure 15.7 we fold in the last four elements (labeled 1 to 4) in the order Element 3, Element 4, Element 1, and ﬁnally Element 2.

Depending on where Element 3 then ends up in the list, Element 4 will now be inserted into a list of size 2 or 3, costing two comparisons in either case. Depending on where Elements 3 and 4 are in the list, Element 1 will now be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7, all of which requires three comparisons to place in sort order. Finally, Element 2 will be inserted into a list of size 5, 6, or 7.', 'A second issue faced by implementors of a list class (or any other data structure that stores a collection of user-deﬁned data elements) is whether the elements stored are all required to be of the same type. This is known as homogeneity in a data structure. In some applications, the user would like to deﬁne the class of the data element that is stored on a given list, and then never permit objects of a different class to be stored on that same list. In other applications, the user would like to permit the objects stored on a single list to be of differing types.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1.

A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', 'A data structure’s primary purpose is to store data in a way that allows efﬁcient access to those data. To provide efﬁcient access, it may be necessary to store addi- tional information about where the data are within the data structure. For example, each node of a linked list must store a pointer to the next value on the list. All such information stored in addition to the actual data values is referred to as overhead. Ideally, overhead should be kept to a minimum while allowing maximum access. The need to maintain a balance between these opposing goals is what makes the study of data structures so interesting.', 'Figure 4.27 shows an array-based queue implementation. listArray holds the queue elements, and as usual, the queue constructor allows an optional param- eter to set the maximum size of the queue.

This might require that the object’s position in the heap representation be updated. Unfortunately, a max-heap is not efﬁcient when searching for an arbitrary value; it is only good for ﬁnding the maximum value. However, if we already know the index for an object within the heap, it is a simple matter to update its priority (including changing its position to maintain the heap property) or remove it. The remove method takes as input the position of the node to be removed from the heap. A typical implementation for priority queues requiring updating of priorities will need to use an auxiliary data structure that supports efﬁcient search for objects (such as a BST). Records in the auxiliary data structure will store the object’s heap index, so that the object can be deleted from the heap and reinserted with its new priority (see Project 5.5).

                Context: ['Two restricted forms of binary tree are sufﬁciently important to warrant special names. Each node in a full binary tree is either (1) an internal node with exactly two non-empty children or (2) a leaf. A complete binary tree has a restricted shape obtained by starting at the root and ﬁlling the tree by levels from left to right. In the complete binary tree of height d, all levels except possibly level d−1 are completely full. The bottom level has its nodes ﬁlled in from the left side.', 'Sec. 5.2 Binary Tree Traversals 3Theorem 5.2 The number of empty subtrees in a non-empty binary tree is one more than the number of nodes in the tree.', 'Note that this representation for serializing general trees cannot be used for bi- nary trees. This is because a binary tree is not merely a restricted form of general tree with at most two children. Every binary tree node has a left and a right child, though either or both might be empty. For example, the representation of Exam- ple 6.8 cannot let us distinguish whether node D in Figure 6.17 is the left or right child of node B. 36.6 Further Reading', 'The previous section points out that a large fraction of the space in a typical binary tree node implementation is devoted to structural overhead, not to storing data. This section presents a simple, compact implementation for complete binary trees. Recall that complete binary trees have all levels except the bottom ﬁlled out com- pletely, and the bottom level has all of its nodes ﬁlled in from left to right. Thus, a complete binary tree of n nodes has only one possible shape. You might think that a complete binary tree is such an unusual occurrence that there is no reason to develop a special implementation for it. However, the complete binary tree has practical uses, the most important being the heap data structure discussed in Sec- tion 5.5. Heaps are often used to implement priority queues (Section 5.5) and for external sorting algorithms (Section 8.5.2).', 'Figure 5.1 illustrates the various terms used to identify parts of a binary tree.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Internal Sorting. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage. Assume that we have R runs to merge. If a simple two-way merge is used, then R runs (regardless of their sizes) will require log R passes through 3Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3InputMemoryOutput1612291614192125295631143525312140295621405640212531291612564031251921252156314019191921253156402914', 'n (cid:88) 3k = Θ(n2). 3k=1 3In the worst case, Quicksort is Θ(n2). This is terrible, no better than Bubble Sort.2 When will this worst case occur? Only when each pivot yields a bad parti- tioning of the array. If the pivot values are selected at random, then this is extremely unlikely to happen. When selecting the middle position of the current subarray, it 32The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'While Ω(n log n) is the theoretical lower bound in the worst case for sorting, many times the input is sufﬁciently well ordered that certain algorithms can take advantage of this fact to speed the sorting process. A simple example is Insertion Sort’s best-case running time. Sorting algorithms whose running time is based on the amount of disorder in the input are called adaptive. For more information on adaptive sorting algorithms, see “A Survey of Adaptive Sorting Algorithms” by Estivill-Castro and Wood [ECW92].', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early.

Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array.

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

The best, worst, or average cases each give us a concrete input instance (or concrete set of instances) that we can apply to an algorithm description to get a cost measure. The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure.

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes.

The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted.

As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort.

So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure.

To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Internal Sorting. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases.

One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

The best, worst, or average cases each give us a concrete input instance (or concrete set of instances) that we can apply to an algorithm description to get a cost measure. The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure.

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Internal Sorting. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

A simple example is Insertion Sort’s best-case running time. Sorting algorithms whose running time is based on the amount of disorder in the input are called adaptive. For more information on adaptive sorting algorithms, see “A Survey of Adaptive Sorting Algorithms” by Estivill-Castro and Wood [ECW92].', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort.

The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', '7.11 Exercises 37.1 Using induction, prove that Insertion Sort will always produce a sorted array. 3257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', '261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 3Modify the Bubble Sort implementation to add this ﬂag and test.

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

The upper and lower bounds describe our understanding of the growth rate for that cost measure.

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

REASON: The score is 0.48 because relevant nodes discussing sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quicksort, Insertion Sort, Mergesort, and others are present, but they are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For instance, the first node in the retrieval context is irrelevant as it discusses 'external sorting', which is not related to internal sorting concepts. Similarly, the second node focuses on 'external sorting efficiency', which should be ranked lower than relevant nodes discussing internal sorting algorithms.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Internal Sorting. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records.

Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5.

However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases.

For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Internal Sorting. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'Given this assumption, the average-case cost is computed from the following 3equation: 3T(n) = cn + 31 n 3n−1 (cid:88) 3k=0 3[T(k) + T(n − 1 − k)], T(0) = T(1) = c.', 'Sec. 15.3 Finding the Maximum Value 3for the “average depth” of the leaf nodes. Deﬁne the total path length as the sum of the levels for each node. The cost of an outcome is the level of the corresponding node plus 1. The average cost of the algorithm is the average cost of the outcomes (total path length/n). What is the tree with the least average depth? This is equiva- lent to the tree that corresponds to binary search. Thus, binary search is optimal in the average case.', 'This is an unusual situation that the average case cost and the worst case cost have asymptotically different growth rates. Consider what “average case” actually means. We compute an average cost for inputs of size n by summing up for every possible input of size n the product of the running time cost of that input times the probability that that input will occur. To simplify things, we assumed that every permutation is equally likely to occur. Thus, ﬁnding the average means summing up the cost for every permutation and dividing by the number of inputs (n!). We know that some of these n! inputs cost O(n2). But the sum of all the permutation costs has to be (n!)(O(n log n)). Given the extremely high cost of the worst inputs, there must be very few of them. In fact, there cannot be a constant fraction of the inputs with cost O(n2). Even, say, 1% of the inputs with cost O(n2) would lead to', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

A simple example is Insertion Sort’s best-case running time. Sorting algorithms whose running time is based on the amount of disorder in the input are called adaptive. For more information on adaptive sorting algorithms, see “A Survey of Adaptive Sorting Algorithms” by Estivill-Castro and Wood [ECW92].', '7.12 Projects 37.1 One possible improvement for Bubble Sort would be to add a ﬂag variable and a test that determines if an exchange was made during the current iter- ation. If no exchange was made, then the list is sorted and so the algorithm can stop early. This makes the best case performance become O(n) (because if the list is already sorted, then no iterations will take place on the ﬁrst pass, and the sort will stop right there). 3261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'Quicksort’s average-case behavior falls somewhere between the extremes of worst and best case. Average-case analysis considers the cost for all possible ar- rangements of input, summing the costs and dividing by the number of cases. We make one reasonable simplifying assumption: At each partition step, the pivot is equally likely to end in any position in the (sorted) array. In other words, the pivot is equally likely to break an array into partitions of sizes 0 and n−1, or 1 and n−2, and so on.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', '7.11 Exercises 37.1 Using induction, prove that Insertion Sort will always produce a sorted array. 3257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', '261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 3Modify the Bubble Sort implementation to add this ﬂag and test.

We can expect this to occur for about half the comparisons in the average case, leading to Θ(n2) for the expected number of swaps. The actual number of swaps performed by Bubble Sort will be identical to that performed by Insertion Sort.', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', 'A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'While the best case is signiﬁcantly faster than the worst case, the worst case is usually a more reliable indication of the “typical” running time. However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'Finding the average cost requires us to use a recurrence with full history, similar to the one we used to model the cost of Quicksort. If we do this, we will ﬁnd that T(n) is in O(n) in the average case.', '7.5 Quicksort 3While Mergesort uses the most obvious form of divide and conquer (split the list in half then sort the halves), it is not the only way that we can break down the sorting problem. And we saw that doing the merge step for Mergesort when using an array implementation is not so easy. So perhaps a different divide and conquer strategy might turn out to be more efﬁcient? 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort', 'insertions and deletions. After the table is loaded with the initial collection of records, the ﬁrst few deletions will lengthen the average probe sequence distance for records (it will add tombstones). Over time, the average distance will reach an equilibrium point because insertions will tend to decrease the average distance by ﬁlling in tombstone slots. For example, after initially loading records into the database, the average path distance might be 1.2 (i.e., an average of 0.2 accesses per search beyond the home position will be required). After a series of insertions and deletions, this average distance might increase to 1.6 due to tombstones. This seems like a small increase, but it is three times longer on average beyond the home position than before deletions.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases. The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', '7.3 The Bubble Sort implementation has the following inner for loop: 3for (int j=n-1; j>i; j--) 3Consider the effect of replacing this with the following statement: 3for (int j=n-1; j>0; j--) 3Would the new implementation work correctly? Would the change affect the asymptotic complexity of the algorithm? How would the change affect the running time of the algorithm?', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', '8.5.1 Simple Approaches to External Sorting', 'that can handle n airplanes quickly enough most of the time, but which fails to perform quickly enough when all n airplanes are coming from the same direction. For other applications — particularly when we wish to aggregate the cost of running the program many times on many different inputs — worst-case analy- sis might not be a representative measure of the algorithm’s performance. Often we prefer to know the average-case running time. This means that we would like to know the typical behavior of the algorithm on inputs of size n. Unfortunately, average-case analysis is not always possible. Average-case analysis ﬁrst requires that we understand how the actual inputs to the program (and their costs) are dis- tributed with respect to the set of all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was stated previously that the sequential search algorithm on average examines half of the array values. This is only true if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position in the array. If this assumption is not correct, then the algorithm does not necessarily examine half of the array values in the average case. See Section 9.2 for further discussion regarding the effects of data distribution on the sequential search algorithm.', 'What is the average number of inversions? Consider a list L containing n val- ues. Deﬁne LR to be L in reverse. L has n(n−1)/2 distinct pairs of values, each of which could potentially be an inversion. Each such pair must either be an inversion in L or in LR. Thus, the total number of inversions in L and LR together is exactly n(n − 1)/2 for an average of n(n − 1)/4 per list. We therefore know with certainty that any sorting algorithm which limits comparisons to adjacent items will cost at least n(n − 1)/4 = Ω(n2) in the average case.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'What is the average-case cost of Insertion Sort? When record i is processed, the number of times through the inner for loop depends on how far “out of order” the record is. In particular, the inner for loop is executed once for each key greater than the key of record i that appears in array positions 0 through i−1. For example, in the leftmost column of Figure 7.1 the value 15 is preceded by ﬁve values greater than 15. Each such occurrence is called an inversion. The number of inversions (i.e., the number of values greater than a given value that occur prior to it in the array) will determine the number of comparisons and swaps that must take place. We need to determine what the average number of inversions will be for the record in position i. We expect on average that half of the keys in the ﬁrst i − 1 array positions will have a value greater than that of the key at position i. Thus, the average case should be about half the cost of the worst case, or around n2/4, which is still Θ(n2). So, the average case is no better than the worst case in asymptotic complexity.', 'Recall the sequential search algorithm to ﬁnd a value K within an array of integers.

Nonetheless, there are situations where one of these simple algorithms is the best tool for the job. 37.2.1 3Insertion Sort', '7.4 The implementation for Mergesort given in Section 7.4 takes an array as in- put and sorts that array. At the beginning of Section 7.4 there is a simple pseudocode implementation for sorting a linked list using Mergesort. Im- plement both a linked list-based version of Mergesort and the array-based version of Mergesort, and compare their running times.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved. Of the sorting algorithms Insertion Sort, Bub- ble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort, Binsort, and Radix Sort, which of these are stable, and which are not? For each one, describe either why it is or is not stable. If a minor change to the implemen- tation would make it stable, describe the change.', 'How big a ﬁle can be merged in one pass? Assuming B blocks were allocated to the heap for replacement selection (resulting in runs of average length 2B blocks), followed by a B-way merge, we can process on average a ﬁle of size 2B2 blocks in a single multiway merge. 2Bk+1 blocks on average can be processed in k B- way merges. To gain some appreciation for how quickly this grows, assume that we have available 0.5MB of working memory, and that a block is 4KB, yielding 128 blocks in working memory. The average run size is 1MB (twice the working memory size). In one pass, 128 runs can be merged. Thus, a ﬁle of size 128MB can, on average, be processed in two passes (one to build the runs, one to do the merge) with only 0.5MB of working memory. As another example, assume blocks are 1KB long and working memory is 1MB = 1024 blocks. Then 1024 runs of average length 2MB (which is about 2GB) can be combined in a single merge pass. A larger block size would reduce the size of the ﬁle that can be processed', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm. Otherwise, we often desire an average-case analysis if we know enough about the distribution of our input to compute the average case. If not, then we must resort to worst-case analysis. 33.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm?', 'Let us look ahead to analyzing the problem of sorting to see how this process works. What is the least possible cost for any sorting algorithm in the worst case? The algorithm must at least look at every element in the input, just to determine that the input is truly sorted. Thus, any sorting algorithm must take at least cn time. For many problems, this observation that each of the n inputs must be looked at leads to an easy Ω(n) lower bound.', 'Let us look ahead to analyzing the problem of sorting to see how this process works.

However, such a comparison 3Sec. 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms', '// Stick pivot at end 3// Put pivot in place // Sort left partition // Sort right partition 3} 3Figure 7.11 Implementation for Quicksort.', '7.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 3Figure 7.5 summarizes the cost of Insertion, Bubble, and Selection Sort in terms of their required number of comparisons and swaps1 in the best, average, and worst cases. The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', 'As with Mergesort, an efﬁcient implementation of Radix Sort is somewhat dif- ﬁcult to achieve. In particular, we would prefer to sort an array of values and avoid processing linked lists. If we know how many values will be in each bin, then an auxiliary array of size r can be used to hold the bins. For example, if during the ﬁrst pass the 0 bin will receive three records and the 1 bin will receive ﬁve records, then we could simply reserve the ﬁrst three array positions for the 0 bin and the next ﬁve array positions for the 1 bin. Exactly this approach is taken by the Java implementation of Figure 7.18.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1. Run your implementations over a large range of problem sizes, timing the results for each algorithm. Graph and compare these timing results. 3Sec. 9.7 Projects', '7.4 When implementing Insertion Sort, a binary search could be used to locate the position within the ﬁrst i − 1 elements of the array into which element i should be inserted. How would this affect the number of comparisons re- quired? How would using such a binary search affect the asymptotic running time for Insertion Sort?', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons. Bi- nary search is inherently much simpler than QBS, because binary search only needs to calculate the midpoint position of the array before each comparison, while quadratic binary search must calculate an interpolation point which is more expen- sive. So the constant factors for QBS are even higher.', '9.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 3The simplest form of search has already been presented in Example 3.1: the se- quential search algorithm. Sequential search on an unsorted list requires Θ(n) time in the worst case.', 'We can categorize search algorithms into three general approaches: 31. Sequential and list methods. 2. Direct access by key value (hashing). 3. Tree indexing methods. 3This and the following chapter treat these three approaches in turn. Any of these approaches are potentially suitable for implementing the Dictionary ADT 3301 3302 3Chap. 9 Searching 3introduced in Section 4.4. However, each has different performance characteristics that make it the method of choice in particular circumstances.', 'This probably sounds convoluted to do two levels of jumping to be followed by a sequential search. While it might make sense to do a two-level algorithm (that is, jump search jumps to ﬁnd a sublist and then does sequential search on the sublist), it almost never seems to make sense to do a three-level algorithm.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1.

Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'Consider a large database of employee records. If the primary key is the em- ployee’s ID number and the secondary key is the employee’s name, then each record in the name index associates a name with one or more ID numbers. The ID number index in turn associates an ID number with a unique pointer to the full record on disk. The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record. It is called a list because each secondary key value has (conceptually) a list of primary keys as- sociated with it. Figure 10.4 illustrates this arrangement. Here, we have last names as the secondary key. The primary key is a four-character unique identiﬁer.', 'How do we handle large databases that require frequent update? The main problem with the linear index is that it is a single, large array that does not adjust well to updates because a single update can require changing the position of every key in the index. Inverted lists reduce this problem, but they are only suitable for sec- ondary key indices with many fewer secondary key values than records. The linear index would perform well as a primary key index if it could somehow be broken into pieces such that individual updates affect only a part of the index. This con- cept will be pursued throughout the rest of this chapter, eventually culminating in the B+-tree, the most widely used indexing method today.

                Context: ['Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'Consider a large database of employee records. If the primary key is the em- ployee’s ID number and the secondary key is the employee’s name, then each record in the name index associates a name with one or more ID numbers. The ID number index in turn associates an ID number with a unique pointer to the full record on disk. The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record. It is called a list because each secondary key value has (conceptually) a list of primary keys as- sociated with it. Figure 10.4 illustrates this arrangement. Here, we have last names as the secondary key. The primary key is a four-character unique identiﬁer.', 'How do we handle large databases that require frequent update? The main problem with the linear index is that it is a single, large array that does not adjust well to updates because a single update can require changing the position of every key in the index. Inverted lists reduce this problem, but they are only suitable for sec- ondary key indices with many fewer secondary key values than records. The linear index would perform well as a primary key index if it could somehow be broken into pieces such that individual updates affect only a part of the index. This con- cept will be pursued throughout the rest of this chapter, eventually culminating in the B+-tree, the most widely used indexing method today. But ﬁrst, we begin by studying ISAM, an early attempt to solve the problem of large databases requiring frequent update. Its weaknesses help to illustrate why the B+-tree works so well.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3Linear IndexDatabase Records42739852375298374273 3Figure 10.1 Linear indexing for variable-length records.

Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. 3In their most general form, database applications have the following character-', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld.', 'Consider a large database of employee records. If the primary key is the em- ployee’s ID number and the secondary key is the employee’s name, then each record in the name index associates a name with one or more ID numbers. The ID number index in turn associates an ID number with a unique pointer to the full record on disk. The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record. It is called a list because each secondary key value has (conceptually) a list of primary keys as- sociated with it. Figure 10.4 illustrates this arrangement. Here, we have last names as the secondary key. The primary key is a four-character unique identiﬁer.', 'How do we handle large databases that require frequent update? The main problem with the linear index is that it is a single, large array that does not adjust well to updates because a single update can require changing the position of every key in the index. Inverted lists reduce this problem, but they are only suitable for sec- ondary key indices with many fewer secondary key values than records. The linear index would perform well as a primary key index if it could somehow be broken into pieces such that individual updates affect only a part of the index. This con- cept will be pursued throughout the rest of this chapter, eventually culminating in the B+-tree, the most widely used indexing method today. But ﬁrst, we begin by studying ISAM, an early attempt to solve the problem of large databases requiring frequent update. Its weaknesses help to illustrate why the B+-tree works so well.', 'Sec. 10.1 Linear Indexing 3Linear IndexDatabase Records42739852375298374273 3Figure 10.1 Linear indexing for variable-length records.

This approach is often unsatisfactory for four reasons. First, there is the effort involved in programming and testing two algorithms when at best you want to keep only one. Second, when empirically comparing two al- gorithms there is always the chance that one of the programs was “better written” than the other, and therefor the relative qualities of the underlying algorithms are not truly represented by their implementations. This can easily occur when the programmer has a bias regarding the algorithms. Third, the choice of empirical test cases might unfairly favor one algorithm. Fourth, you could ﬁnd that even the better of the two algorithms does not fall within your resource budget. In that case you must begin the entire process again with yet another program implementing a new algorithm. But, how would you know if any algorithm can meet the resource budget? Perhaps the problem is simply too difﬁcult for any implementation to be within budget.', '8.3 Buffers and Buffer Pools 8.4 The Programmer’s View of Files 8.5 External Sorting 38.5.1 8.5.2 Replacement Selection 8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3Simple Approaches to External Sorting 38.6 Further Reading 8.7 Exercises 8.8 Projects 39 Searching 39.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 9.2 Self-Organizing Lists 9.3 Bit Vectors for Representing Sets 9.4 Hashing', '1. Each data structure and each algorithm has costs and beneﬁts. Practitioners need a thorough understanding of how to assess costs and beneﬁts to be able to adapt to new design challenges. This requires an understanding of the principles of algorithm analysis, and also an appreciation for the signiﬁcant effects of the physical medium employed (e.g., data stored on disk versus main memory).', 'We can get some further insight into relative growth rates for various algorithms from Figure 3.2. Most of the growth rates that appear in typical algorithms are shown, along with some representative input sizes. Once again, we see that the growth rate has a tremendous effect on the resources consumed by an algorithm. 3Sec. 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 33.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases', 'How about the worst case? The advantage to analyzing the worst case is that you know for certain that the algorithm must perform at least that well. This is es- pecially important for real-time applications, such as for the computers that monitor an air trafﬁc control system. Here, it would not be acceptable to use an algorithm 359 360 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis', 'In summary, for real-time applications we are likely to prefer a worst-case anal- ysis of an algorithm. Otherwise, we often desire an average-case analysis if we know enough about the distribution of our input to compute the average case. If not, then we must resort to worst-case analysis. 33.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm?', '483 315 3Lower Bounds 3How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem? If my algorithm runs in Θ(n log n) time, is that good? It would be if I were sorting the records stored in an array. But it would be terrible if I were searching the array for the largest element. The value of an algorithm must be determined in relation to the inherent complexity of the problem at hand.', 'When analyzing an algorithm, should we study the best, worst, or average case? Normally we are not interested in the best case, because this might happen only rarely and generally is too optimistic for a fair characterization of the algorithm’s running time. In other words, analysis based on the best case is not likely to be representative of the behavior of the algorithm. However, there are rare instances where a best-case analysis is useful — in particular, when the best case has high probability of occurring. In Chapter 7 you will see some examples where taking advantage of the best-case running time for one sorting algorithm makes a second more efﬁcient.']

We can solve this problem by consistently storing the edge such that the lesser of I and J always comes ﬁrst. Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5.

Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we notice that only the lower triangle of the array is used.

For Dijkstra’s shortest paths algorithm, two different implementations were given in Sec- tion 11.4.1 that provide different ways for determining the next closest vertex at each iteration of the algorithm. The relative costs of these two variants depend on who sparse or dense the graph is. They might also depend on whether the graph is implemented using an adjacency list or adjacency ma- trix.

                Context: ['Figure 11.7 presents an implementation of the adjacency list representation for graphs. Its main data structure is an array of linked lists, one linked list for each vertex. These linked lists store objects of type Edge, which merely stores the index for the vertex pointed to by the edge, along with the weight of the edge. 3/** Edge class for Adjacency List graph representation */ class Edge { 3private int vert, wt; 3public Edge(int v, int w) // Constructor 3{ vert = v; wt = w; }', 'We begin in Section 11.1 with some basic graph terminology and then deﬁne two fundamental representations for graphs, the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.2 presents a graph ADT and simple implementations based on the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Both the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list can be used to store directed or undirected graphs. Each edge of an undirected graph connecting Vertices U and V is represented by two directed edges: one from U to V and one from V to U. Figure 11.4 illustrates the use of the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list for undirected graphs.', 'Which graph representation is more space efﬁcient depends on the number of edges in the graph. The adjacency list stores information only for those edges that actually appear in the graph, while the adjacency matrix requires space for each potential edge, whether it exists or not. However, the adjacency matrix requires no overhead for pointers, which can be a substantial cost, especially if the only 3Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432', 'information stored for an edge is one bit to indicate its existence.

The sample implementations pre- sented here do not address the issue of how the graph is actually created.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data type and its physical implementation in a computer program. For example, there are two tra- ditional implementations for the list data type: the linked list and the array-based list. The list data type can therefore be implemented using a linked list or an ar- ray. Even the term “array” is ambiguous in that it can refer either to a data type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each memory location stores one ﬁxed-length data item. By this meaning, an array is a physical data structure. However, array can also mean a logical data type composed of a (typically ho- mogeneous) collection of data items, with each data item identiﬁed by an index It is possible to implement arrays in many different ways. For exam- number.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list.

REASON: The score is 0.10 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'sublists', is ranked tenth. This is directly related to the expected output concept 'Sublists'. However, the score is not higher because the first nine nodes in the retrieval context are irrelevant, discussing topics like 'storage and access of list elements in an array', 'advantages and disadvantages of array-based and linked lists', and 'stack implementation using arrays', which do not relate to the expected output concepts.

Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list.

One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', 'A distinction should be made between the logical concept of a data type and its physical implementation in a computer program.

The list data type can therefore be implemented using a linked list or an ar- ray. Even the term “array” is ambiguous in that it can refer either to a data type or an implementation. “Array” is commonly used in computer programming to mean a contiguous block of memory locations, where each memory location stores one ﬁxed-length data item.

                Context: ['This chapter introduces several tree structures designed for use in specialized ap- plications. The trie of Section 13.1 is commonly used to store and retrieve strings. It also serves to illustrate the concept of a key space decomposition. The AVL tree and splay tree of Section 13.2 are variants on the BST. They are examples of self-balancing search trees and have guaranteed good performance regardless of the insertion order for records. An introduction to several spatial data structures used to organize point data by xy-coordinates is presented in Section 13.3.', 'Consider what happens when we insert a node with key value 5, as shown in Figure 13.4. The tree on the left meets the AVL tree balance requirements. After the insertion, two nodes no longer meet the requirements. Because the original tree met the balance requirement, nodes in the new tree can only be unbalanced by a difference of at most 2 in the subtrees. For the bottommost unbalanced node, call it S, there are 4 cases:', '1. B-trees are always height balanced, with all leaf nodes at the same level. 2. Update and search operations affect only a few disk blocks. The fewer the number of disk blocks affected, the less disk I/O is required. 33. B-trees keep related records (that is, records with similar key values) on the same disk block, which helps to minimize disk I/O on searches due to locality of reference.', 'YSYXABSCDXCA(a)BD(b) 3Figure 13.6 A double rotation in an AVL tree. This operation occurs when the excess node (in subtree B) is in the right child of the left child of the unbalanced node labeled S. By rearranging the nodes as shown, we preserve the BST property, as well as re-balance the tree to preserve the AVL tree balance property. The case where the excess node is in the left child of the right child of S is handled in the same way.', 'way that retains the BST property. While Figure 13.7 is slightly different from Figure 13.5, in fact the splay tree single rotation is identical to the AVL tree single rotation. 3Unlike the AVL tree, the splay tree requires two types of double rotation. Dou- ble rotations involve S, its parent (call it P), and S’s grandparent (call it G). The effect of a double rotation is to move S up two levels in the tree. 3The ﬁrst double rotation is called a zigzag rotation. It takes place when either', 'The B-tree is a generalization of the 2-3 tree. Put another way, a 2-3 tree is a B-tree of order three. Normally, the size of a node in the B-tree is chosen to ﬁll a disk block. A B-tree node implementation typically allows 100 or more children. Thus, a B-tree node is equivalent to a disk block, and a “pointer” value stored in the tree is actually the number of the block containing the child node (usually interpreted as an offset from the beginning of the corresponding disk ﬁle). In a typical application, the B-tree’s access to the disk ﬁle will be managed using a buffer pool and a block-replacement scheme such as LRU (see Section 8.3).', '436 3Chap. 13 Advanced Tree Structures 3SXCXSBBCA(a)A(b) 3Figure 13.5 A single rotation in an AVL tree.

Each node contains up to three keys, 3and internal nodes have up to four children. 3Search in a B-tree is a generalization of search in a 2-3 tree.

Thus, the storage utilization must be at least 50%. This is satisfactory for many implementations, but note that keeping nodes fuller will result both in less space required (because there is less empty space in the disk ﬁle) and in more efﬁcient processing (fewer blocks on average will be read into memory because the amount of information in each block is greater). Because B-trees have become so popular, many algorithm designers have tried to improve B-tree performance. One method for doing so is to use the B+-tree variant known as the B∗-tree. The B∗-tree is identical to the B+-tree, except for the rules used to split and merge nodes. Instead of splitting a node in half when it overﬂows, the B∗-tree gives some records to its', 'A different approach to improving the performance of the BST is to not require that the tree always be balanced, but rather to expend some effort toward making the BST more balanced every time it is accessed. This is a little like the idea of path compression used by the UNION/FIND algorithm presented in Section 6.2. One example of such a compromise is called the splay tree. The splay tree is described in Section 13.2.2. 3Sec. 13.2 Balanced Trees 372324240120374224723242401203742245', 'A B-tree of order m is deﬁned to have the following shape properties: 3The root is either a leaf or has at least two children. • Each internal node, except for the root, has between (cid:100)m/2(cid:101) and m children. • All leaves are at the same level in the tree, so the tree is always height bal- anced.', 'Section 6.1 presents general tree terminology. Section 6.2 presents a simple representation for solving the important problem of processing equivalence classes. Several pointer-based implementations for general trees are covered in Section 6.3. Aside from general trees and binary trees, there are also uses for trees whose in- ternal nodes have a ﬁxed number K of children where K is something other than two. Such trees are known as K-ary trees. Section 6.4 generalizes the properties of binary trees to K-ary trees. Sequential representations, useful for applications such as storing trees on disk, are covered in Section 6.5.', 'Poor balance and clumping can result when certain preﬁxes are heavily used. For example, an alphabet trie storing the common words in the English language would have many words in the “th” branch of the tree, but none in the “zq” branch. Any multiway branching trie can be replaced with a binary trie by replacing the original trie’s alphabet with an equivalent binary code.

Rather than focusing on the indi- vidual cost of each operation independently and summing them, amortized analysis looks at the cost of the entire series and “charges” each individual operation with a share of the total cost.', 'Sec. 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 33.4 Asymptotic Analysis', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The beneﬁts of being able to discover a strong lower bound are signiﬁcant. In particular, when we can make the upper and lower bounds for a problem meet, this means that we truly understand our problem in a theoretical sense. It also saves us the effort of attempting to discover more (asymptotically) efﬁcient algorithms when no such algorithm can exist.', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'This book contains many analyses for algorithms. These analyses generally deﬁne the upper and lower bounds for algorithms in their worst and average cases. For many of the algorithms presented so far, analysis has been easy. This section con- siders a more difﬁcult task — an analysis for the cost of a problem as opposed to an algorithm. The upper bound for a problem can be deﬁned as the asymptotic cost of the fastest known algorithm. The lower bound deﬁnes the best possible efﬁciency for any algorithm that solves the problem, including algorithms not yet invented. Once the upper and lower bounds for the problem meet, we know that no future algorithm can possibly be (asymptotically) more efﬁcient.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '4.

For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'The beneﬁts of being able to discover a strong lower bound are signiﬁcant. In particular, when we can make the upper and lower bounds for a problem meet, this means that we truly understand our problem in a theoretical sense.

Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'This book contains many analyses for algorithms. These analyses generally deﬁne the upper and lower bounds for algorithms in their worst and average cases. For many of the algorithms presented so far, analysis has been easy. This section con- siders a more difﬁcult task — an analysis for the cost of a problem as opposed to an algorithm. The upper bound for a problem can be deﬁned as the asymptotic cost of the fastest known algorithm. The lower bound deﬁnes the best possible efﬁciency for any algorithm that solves the problem, including algorithms not yet invented. Once the upper and lower bounds for the problem meet, we know that no future algorithm can possibly be (asymptotically) more efﬁcient.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '4.

These analyses generally deﬁne the upper and lower bounds for algorithms in their worst and average cases. For many of the algorithms presented so far, analysis has been easy. This section con- siders a more difﬁcult task — an analysis for the cost of a problem as opposed to an algorithm. The upper bound for a problem can be deﬁned as the asymptotic cost of the fastest known algorithm. The lower bound deﬁnes the best possible efﬁciency for any algorithm that solves the problem, including algorithms not yet invented. Once the upper and lower bounds for the problem meet, we know that no future algorithm can possibly be (asymptotically) more efﬁcient.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', 'Given this deﬁnition for searching, we can easily come up with the standard sequential search algorithm, and we can also see that the lower bound for this prob- lem is “obviously” n comparisons. (Keep in mind that the key K might not actually appear in the list.) However, lower bounds proofs are a bit slippery, and it is in- structive to see how they can go wrong. 3Theorem 15.1 The lower bound for the problem of searching in an unsorted list is n comparisons.']

The fifth node is also relevant, listing 'Randomized Algorithms' and 'Numerical Algorithms', both mentioned in the expected output. However, the second node, which focuses on 'analysis techniques and lower bounds', is not directly related and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the third node discusses 'solving recurrence relations', which is not directly mentioned in the expected output, and should also be ranked lower. These irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than other relevant nodes contribute to the score not being higher.

Instead, such algorithms are typically imple- mented by building the table of subproblems from the bottom up. Thus, fibi bet- ter represents the most common form of dynamic programming than does fibrt, even though it doesn’t use the complete table.', 'V Theory of Algorithms 314 Analysis Techniques 314.1 Summation Techniques 14.2 Recurrence Relations 314.2.1 Estimating Upper and Lower Bounds 14.2.2 Expanding Recurrences 14.2.3 Divide and Conquer Recurrences 14.2.4 Average-Case Analysis of Quicksort 314.3 Amortized Analysis 14.4 Further Reading 14.5 Exercises 14.6 Projects 315 Lower Bounds 315.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 315.2.1 Searching in Unsorted Lists 15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists', 'There are many approaches to solving recurrence relations, and we brieﬂy con- sider three here. The ﬁrst is an estimation technique: Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove the bounds, and tighten as re- quired. The second approach is to expand the recurrence to convert it to a summa- tion and then use summation techniques. The third approach is to take advantage of already proven theorems when the recurrence is of a suitable form. In particu- lar, typical divide and conquer algorithms such as Mergesort yield recurrences of a form that ﬁts a pattern for which we have a ready solution.', 'Those who are unfamiliar with recursion might ﬁnd it hard to accept that it is used primarily as a tool for simplifying the design and description of algorithms. A recursive algorithm usually does not yield the most efﬁcient computer program for solving the problem because recursion involves function calls, which are typi- cally more expensive than other alternatives such as a while loop. However, the recursive approach usually provides an algorithm that is reasonably efﬁcient in the sense discussed in Chapter 3. (But not always! See Exercise 2.11.)

This comes as a result of the fact that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. 317.3.1 Uncountability 3Before proving that the Halting Problem is unsolvable, we ﬁrst prove that not all functions can be implemented as a computer program. This must be so because the number of programs is much smaller than the number of possible functions.', 'Example 17.4 Consider the following variation on the Halting Problem. Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', '17.4 Further Reading 3The classic text on the theory of N P-completeness is Computers and Intractabil- ity: A Guide to the Theory of N P-completeness by Garey and Johnston [GJ79].

Now we will prove that the Halting Problem cannot be computed by any computer program. The proof is by contradiction.', '555 3556 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3we cannot analyze. This comes as a result of the fact that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. 317.3.1 Uncountability 3Before proving that the Halting Problem is unsolvable, we ﬁrst prove that not all functions can be implemented as a computer program. This must be so because the number of programs is much smaller than the number of possible functions.', 'Example 17.4 Consider the following variation on the Halting Problem. Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', '17.4 Further Reading 3The classic text on the theory of N P-completeness is Computers and Intractabil- ity: A Guide to the Theory of N P-completeness by Garey and Johnston [GJ79]. The Traveling Salesman Problem, edited by Lawler et al.

Section 17.1 presents the concept of a reduction, which is the central tool used for analyzing the difﬁculty of a problem (as opposed to analyzing the cost of an algorithm). Reductions allow us to relate the difﬁculty of various problems, which is often much easier than doing the analysis for a problem from ﬁrst principles. Section 17.2 discusses “hard” problems, by which we mean prob- lems that require, or at least appear to require, time exponential on the input size. Finally, Section 17.3 considers various problems that, while often simple to deﬁne and comprehend, are in fact impossible to solve using a computer program. The classic example of such a problem is deciding whether an arbitrary computer pro- gram will go into an inﬁnite loop when processing a speciﬁed input. This is known as the halting problem.', 'The theory of N P-completeness gives a technique for separating tractable from (probably) intractable problems. Recalling the algorithm for generating algorithms in Section 15.1, we can reﬁne it for problems that we suspect are N P-complete. When faced with a new problem, we might alternate between checking if it is tractable (that is, we try to ﬁnd a polynomial-time solution) and checking if it is intractable (we try to prove the problem is N P-complete). While proving that some problem is N P-complete does not actually make our upper bound for our', 'So a crucial ﬁrst step to getting this whole theory off the ground is ﬁnding one problem that is N P-hard.

This comes as a result of the fact that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. 317.3.1 Uncountability 3Before proving that the Halting Problem is unsolvable, we ﬁrst prove that not all functions can be implemented as a computer program. This must be so because the number of programs is much smaller than the number of possible functions.', 'Example 17.4 Consider the following variation on the Halting Problem. Given a computer program, will it halt when its input is the empty string? That is, will it halt when it is given no input? To prove that this problem is unsolvable, we will employ a standard technique for computability proofs: Use a computer program to modify another computer program. Proof: Assume that there is a function Ehalt that determines whether a given program halts when given no input. Recall that our proof for the Halting Problem involved functions that took as parameters a string rep- resenting a program and another string representing an input. Consider another function combine that takes a program P and an input string I as parameters. Function combine modiﬁes P to store I as a static variable S and further modiﬁes all calls to input functions within P to instead get their input from S. Call the resulting program P (cid:48). It should take no stretch of the imagination to believe that any decent compiler could be modiﬁed to take computer programs and input strings and produce a new computer program that has been modiﬁed in this way. Now, take P (cid:48) and feed it to Ehalt. If Ehalt says that P (cid:48) will halt, then we know that P would halt on input I. In other words, we now have a procedure for solving the original Halting Problem. The only assumption that we made was the existence of Ehalt. Thus, the problem of determining if a program will halt on no input must (cid:50) be unsolvable.', '17.4 Further Reading 3The classic text on the theory of N P-completeness is Computers and Intractabil- ity: A Guide to the Theory of N P-completeness by Garey and Johnston [GJ79]. The Traveling Salesman Problem, edited by Lawler et al.

Section 17.1 presents the concept of a reduction, which is the central tool used for analyzing the difﬁculty of a problem (as opposed to analyzing the cost of an algorithm). Reductions allow us to relate the difﬁculty of various problems, which is often much easier than doing the analysis for a problem from ﬁrst principles. Section 17.2 discusses “hard” problems, by which we mean prob- lems that require, or at least appear to require, time exponential on the input size. Finally, Section 17.3 considers various problems that, while often simple to deﬁne and comprehend, are in fact impossible to solve using a computer program. The classic example of such a problem is deciding whether an arbitrary computer pro- gram will go into an inﬁnite loop when processing a speciﬁed input. This is known as the halting problem.', 'The theory of N P-completeness gives a technique for separating tractable from (probably) intractable problems. Recalling the algorithm for generating algorithms in Section 15.1, we can reﬁne it for problems that we suspect are N P-complete. When faced with a new problem, we might alternate between checking if it is tractable (that is, we try to ﬁnd a polynomial-time solution) and checking if it is intractable (we try to prove the problem is N P-complete). While proving that some problem is N P-complete does not actually make our upper bound for our', 'So a crucial ﬁrst step to getting this whole theory off the ground is ﬁnding one problem that is N P-hard.
