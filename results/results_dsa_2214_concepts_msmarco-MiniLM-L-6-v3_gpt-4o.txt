Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Algorithm Analysis. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and fundamental tech- niques of algorithm analysis. We focus on a methodology known as asymptotic algorithm analysis, or simply asymptotic analysis. Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource consumption of an algorithm. It allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more algorithms for solving the same problem. Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource constraints for a problem before they imple- ment an actual program. After reading this chapter, you should understand', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', 'Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction 33 Algorithm Analysis 33.1 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 3.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm? 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 3Introduction 33.4.1 Upper Bounds 3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3.4.3 Θ Notation 3.4.4 3.4.5 Classifying Functions 3Simplifying Rules', 'Algorithms: An algorithm is a method or a process followed to solve a problem. If the problem is viewed as a function, then an algorithm is an implementation for the function that transforms an input to the corresponding output. A problem can be solved by many different algorithms. A given algorithm solves only one problem (i.e., computes a particular function). This book covers many problems, and for several of these problems I present more than one algorithm. For the important problem of sorting I present nearly a dozen algorithms!', '3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3Big-Oh notation describes an upper bound. In other words, big-Oh notation states a claim about the greatest amount of some resource (usually time) that is required by an algorithm for some class of inputs of size n (typically the worst such input, the average of all possible inputs, or the best such input).', 'So far all of our examples of algorithm analysis give “obvious” results, with big-Oh always matching Ω. To understand how big-Oh, Ω, and Θ notations are properly used to describe our understanding of a problem or an algorithm, it is best to consider an example where you do not already know a lot about the problem.', '15.1 Consider the so-called “algorithm for algorithms” in Section 15.1. Is this really an algorithm? Review the deﬁnition of an algorithm from Section 1.4. Which parts of the deﬁnition apply, and which do not? Is the “algorithm for algorithms” a heuristic for ﬁnding a good algorithm? Why or why not? 15.2 Single-elimination tournaments are notorious for their scheduling difﬁcul- ties.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.8345481917463341 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.83 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms' and 'asymptotic complexity analysis,' which are directly relevant to the expected output. However, the seventh node, which provides a general definition of algorithms, is not directly related to the specific concepts and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the ninth node discusses notations in algorithm analysis without directly contributing to the expected output, and the tenth node discusses a hypothetical 'algorithm for algorithms,' which is not relevant. These irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than some relevant nodes prevent the score from being higher.

For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists, Stacks, and Queues. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', 'We begin by deﬁning an ADT for lists in Section 4.1. Two implementations for the list ADT — the array-based list and the linked list — are covered in detail and their relative merits discussed. Sections 4.2 and 4.3 cover stacks and queues, re- spectively. Sample implementations for each of these data structures are presented.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.913447971781305 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.91 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses the concept of 'LIFO' and the use of stacks, which is directly relevant to the expected output mentioning 'Stacks'. However, the sixth node, which provides a code snippet for a stack ADT without introducing new concepts relevant to the expected output, is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. Similarly, the tenth node discusses queue states and stack operations but does not introduce new concepts relevant to the expected output, yet it is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. These instances of irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than relevant ones prevent the score from being higher.

                Context: ['Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT.

One example is the threaded binary tree. Extending the node implementation of Figure 5.7, the threaded binary tree stores with each node two additional bit ﬁelds that indicate if the child pointers lc and rc are regular pointers to child nodes or threads. If lc is not a pointer to a non-empty child (i.e., if it would be null in a regular binary tree), then it instead stores a pointer to the inorder predecessor of that node. The inorder predecessor is the node that would be printed immediately before the current node in an inorder traversal.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.7624323593073593 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.76 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'full binary tree' and 'complete binary tree', which are key concepts related to binary trees, while the fourth node focuses on 'threaded binary tree', which is not directly mentioned in the expected output. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the ninth node providing an example of inorder enumeration, are ranked above relevant nodes like the tenth node discussing 'preorder', 'postorder', and 'inorder' traversals, which are key concepts in the expected output.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Recall ---> SCORE: 0.8181818181818182 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.82 because most of the expected output sentences are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, particularly node 3, which covers a wide range of topics like 'Binary Search Trees', 'Binary Trees', and 'Huffman Coding Trees'. However, some specific terms like 'tree terminology' and 'Huffman Tree Traversal' are not explicitly mentioned in any node, leading to a slightly lower score.

REASON: The score is 0.37 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the third node mentioning 'General Tree class implementation', the sixth node discussing 'Full and complete 3-ary trees' and 'Sequential Tree Implementations', the seventh node on 'Dynamic general tree representation' and 'Left-Child/Right-Sibling Implementation', and the tenth node on 'K-ary tree' and 'Sequential representation', are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. Irrelevant nodes, like the first node discussing 'binary trees, which are not directly related to non-binary trees', and the second node about 'binary trees and their serialization', are ranked higher, reducing the precision score.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Internal Sorting. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort is aptly named because, when properly implemented, it is the fastest known general-purpose in-memory sorting algorithm in the average case. It does not require the extra array needed by Mergesort, so it is space efﬁcient as well. Quicksort is widely used, and is typically the algorithm implemented in a library sort routine such as the UNIX qsort function. Interestingly, Quicksort is ham- pered by exceedingly poor worst-case performance, thus making it inappropriate for certain applications.', '257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 37.2 Write an Insertion Sort algorithm for integer key values. However, here’s the catch: The input is a stack (not an array), and the only variables that your algorithm may use are a ﬁxed number of integers and a ﬁxed number of stacks. The algorithm should return a stack containing the records in sorted order (with the least value being at the top of the stack). Your algorithm should be Θ(n2) in the worst case.', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results.

This measure is usually closely related to the running time for the algorithm and has the advantage of being machine and data- type independent. However, in some cases records might be so large that their physical movement might take a signiﬁcant fraction of the total running time. If so, it might be appropriate to measure the number of swap operations performed by the algorithm. In most applications we can assume that all records and keys are of ﬁxed length, and that a single comparison or a single swap operation requires a constant amount of time regardless of which keys are involved. Some special situations “change the rules” for comparing sorting algorithms. For example, an application with records or keys having widely varying length (such as sorting a sequence of variable length strings) will beneﬁt from a special-purpose sorting technique. Some applications require that a small number of records be sorted, but that the sort be performed frequently. An example would be an application that repeatedly sorts groups of ﬁve numbers.

Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order.

All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort is aptly named because, when properly implemented, it is the fastest known general-purpose in-memory sorting algorithm in the average case. It does not require the extra array needed by Mergesort, so it is space efﬁcient as well. Quicksort is widely used, and is typically the algorithm implemented in a library sort routine such as the UNIX qsort function. Interestingly, Quicksort is ham- pered by exceedingly poor worst-case performance, thus making it inappropriate for certain applications.', '257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 37.2 Write an Insertion Sort algorithm for integer key values. However, here’s the catch: The input is a stack (not an array), and the only variables that your algorithm may use are a ﬁxed number of integers and a ﬁxed number of stacks. The algorithm should return a stack containing the records in sorted order (with the least value being at the top of the stack). Your algorithm should be Θ(n2) in the worst case.', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'm1 + (m2 + m1) = Θ(m1 + m2). 3A similar argument was used in our analysis for the partition function in the Quicksort algorithm (Section 7.5). While on any given pass through the while loop the left or right pointers might move all the way through the remainder of the 3477 3478 3Chap. 14 Analysis Techniques 3partition, doing so would reduce the number of times that the while loop can be further executed.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our discussion of Quicksort began by considering the practicality of using a binary search tree for sorting. The BST requires more space than the other sorting meth- ods and will be slower than Quicksort or Mergesort due to the relative expense of inserting values into the tree. There is also the possibility that the BST might be un- balanced, leading to a Θ(n2) worst-case running time. Subtree balance in the BST is closely related to Quicksort’s partition step. Quicksort’s pivot serves roughly the same purpose as the BST root value in that the left partition (subtree) stores val- ues less than the pivot (root) value, while the right partition (subtree) stores values greater than or equal to the pivot (root).', 'where the pivot is the least value in that partition. Function partition returns the ﬁrst index of the right partition so that the subarray bound for the recursive calls to qsort can be determined.

For example, Insertion Sort sequentially compares the value to be inserted into the sorted list until a comparison against the next value in the list fails. In contrast, Radix Sort has no direct comparison of key values. All decisions are based on the value of speciﬁc digits in the key value, so it is possible to take approaches to sorting that do not involve key comparisons. Of course, Radix Sort in the end does not provide a more efﬁcient sorting algorithm than comparison-based sorting. Thus, empirical evidence suggests that comparison-based sorting is a good approach.3', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'Let us assume for the moment that Y is less than X and so the left branch is taken.

For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for', 'Quicksort’s best case occurs when findpivot always breaks the array into two equal halves. Quicksort repeatedly splits the array into smaller partitions, as shown in Figure 7.14. In the best case, the result will be log n levels of partitions, with the top level having one array of size n, the second level two arrays of size n/2, the next with four arrays of size n/4, and so on. Thus, at each level, all partition steps for that level do a total of n work, for an overall cost of n log n work when Quicksort ﬁnds perfect pivots.', '// Stick pivot at end 3// Put pivot in place // Sort left partition // Sort right partition 3} 3Figure 7.11 Implementation for Quicksort.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'Quicksort ﬁrst selects a value called the pivot. (This is conceptually like the root node’s value in the BST.) Assume that the input array contains k values less than the pivot. The records are then rearranged in such a way that the k values less than the pivot are placed in the ﬁrst, or leftmost, k positions in the array, and the values greater than or equal to the pivot are placed in the last, or rightmost, n − k positions. This is called a partition of the array. The values placed in a given partition need not (and typically will not) be sorted with respect to each other. All that is required is that all values end up in the correct partition. The pivot value itself is placed in position k. Quicksort then proceeds to sort the resulting subarrays now on either side of the pivot, one of size k and the other of size n − k − 1. How are these values sorted? Because Quicksort is such a good algorithm, using Quicksort on the subarrays would be appropriate.', 'Under this model, a sorting algorithm reads a block of data into a buffer in main memory, performs some processing on it, and at some future time writes it back to disk. From Section 8.1 we see that reading or writing a block from disk takes on the order of one million times longer than a memory access. Based on this fact, we can reasonably expect that the records contained in a single block can be sorted by an internal sorting algorithm such as Quicksort in less time than is required to read or write the block.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort.

                Context: ['A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort is aptly named because, when properly implemented, it is the fastest known general-purpose in-memory sorting algorithm in the average case. It does not require the extra array needed by Mergesort, so it is space efﬁcient as well. Quicksort is widely used, and is typically the algorithm implemented in a library sort routine such as the UNIX qsort function. Interestingly, Quicksort is ham- pered by exceedingly poor worst-case performance, thus making it inappropriate for certain applications.', '257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 37.2 Write an Insertion Sort algorithm for integer key values. However, here’s the catch: The input is a stack (not an array), and the only variables that your algorithm may use are a ﬁxed number of integers and a ﬁxed number of stacks. The algorithm should return a stack containing the records in sorted order (with the least value being at the top of the stack). Your algorithm should be Θ(n2) in the worst case.', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'm1 + (m2 + m1) = Θ(m1 + m2). 3A similar argument was used in our analysis for the partition function in the Quicksort algorithm (Section 7.5). While on any given pass through the while loop the left or right pointers might move all the way through the remainder of the 3477 3478 3Chap. 14 Analysis Techniques 3partition, doing so would reduce the number of times that the while loop can be further executed.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our discussion of Quicksort began by considering the practicality of using a binary search tree for sorting. The BST requires more space than the other sorting meth- ods and will be slower than Quicksort or Mergesort due to the relative expense of inserting values into the tree. There is also the possibility that the BST might be un- balanced, leading to a Θ(n2) worst-case running time. Subtree balance in the BST is closely related to Quicksort’s partition step. Quicksort’s pivot serves roughly the same purpose as the BST root value in that the left partition (subtree) stores val- ues less than the pivot (root) value, while the right partition (subtree) stores values greater than or equal to the pivot (root).', 'where the pivot is the least value in that partition.

For example, Insertion Sort sequentially compares the value to be inserted into the sorted list until a comparison against the next value in the list fails. In contrast, Radix Sort has no direct comparison of key values. All decisions are based on the value of speciﬁc digits in the key value, so it is possible to take approaches to sorting that do not involve key comparisons. Of course, Radix Sort in the end does not provide a more efﬁcient sorting algorithm than comparison-based sorting. Thus, empirical evidence suggests that comparison-based sorting is a good approach.3', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', 'Let us assume for the moment that Y is less than X and so the left branch is taken.

For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for', 'Quicksort’s best case occurs when findpivot always breaks the array into two equal halves. Quicksort repeatedly splits the array into smaller partitions, as shown in Figure 7.14. In the best case, the result will be log n levels of partitions, with the top level having one array of size n, the second level two arrays of size n/2, the next with four arrays of size n/4, and so on. Thus, at each level, all partition steps for that level do a total of n work, for an overall cost of n log n work when Quicksort ﬁnds perfect pivots.', '// Stick pivot at end 3// Put pivot in place // Sort left partition // Sort right partition 3} 3Figure 7.11 Implementation for Quicksort.', 'The next sorting algorithm that we consider is called Shellsort, named after its inventor, D.L. Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'Quicksort ﬁrst selects a value called the pivot. (This is conceptually like the root node’s value in the BST.) Assume that the input array contains k values less than the pivot. The records are then rearranged in such a way that the k values less than the pivot are placed in the ﬁrst, or leftmost, k positions in the array, and the values greater than or equal to the pivot are placed in the last, or rightmost, n − k positions. This is called a partition of the array. The values placed in a given partition need not (and typically will not) be sorted with respect to each other. All that is required is that all values end up in the correct partition. The pivot value itself is placed in position k. Quicksort then proceeds to sort the resulting subarrays now on either side of the pivot, one of size k and the other of size n − k − 1. How are these values sorted? Because Quicksort is such a good algorithm, using Quicksort on the subarrays would be appropriate.', 'Under this model, a sorting algorithm reads a block of data into a buffer in main memory, performs some processing on it, and at some future time writes it back to disk. From Section 8.1 we see that reading or writing a block from disk takes on the order of one million times longer than a memory access. Based on this fact, we can reasonably expect that the records contained in a single block can be sorted by an internal sorting algorithm such as Quicksort in less time than is required to read or write the block.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', '8.3 Buffers and Buffer Pools 8.4 The Programmer’s View of Files 8.5 External Sorting 38.5.1 8.5.2 Replacement Selection 8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3Simple Approaches to External Sorting 38.6 Further Reading 8.7 Exercises 8.8 Projects 39 Searching 39.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 9.2 Self-Organizing Lists 9.3 Bit Vectors for Representing Sets 9.4 Hashing', '261 3262 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 3Modify the Bubble Sort implementation to add this ﬂag and test.

However, there are situations where we can expect the input to be in sorted or nearly sorted order. One example is when an already sorted list is slightly disordered by a small number of additions to the list; restoring sorted order using Insertion Sort might be a good idea if we know that the disordering is slight. Examples of algorithms that take ad- vantage of Insertion Sort’s near-best-case running time are the Shellsort algorithm of Section 7.3 and the Quicksort algorithm of Section 7.5.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved.

The running time for each of these sorts is Θ(n2) in the average and worst cases.', 'Here the key value is used to determine the position for a record in the ﬁnal sorted array. This is the most basic example of a Binsort, where key values are used to assign records to bins. This algorithm is extremely efﬁcient, taking Θ(n) time regardless of the initial ordering of the keys. This is far better than the performance of any sorting algorithm that we have seen so far. The only problem is that this algorithm has limited use because it works only for a permutation of the numbers from 0 to n − 1.', '7.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents 3195 3196 3197 3199 3206 3206 3206 3207 3210 3210 3212 3215 3215 3218 3221 3223 3224 3225 3225 3227 3229 3230 3231 3233 3236 3243 3244 3251 3253 3257 3257 3261 3Contents 38 File Processing and External Sorting 8.1 Primary versus Secondary Storage 8.2 Disk Drives 38.2.1 Disk Drive Architecture 8.2.2 Disk Access Costs 38.3 Buffers and Buffer Pools 8.4 The Programmer’s View of Files 8.5 External Sorting', 'When comparing two sorting algorithms, the most straightforward approach would seem to be simply program both and measure their running times.

However, such a comparison 3Sec. 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms', 'As deﬁned, the Sorting Problem allows input with two or more records that have the same key value. Certain applications require that input not contain duplicate key values. The sorting algorithms presented in this chapter and in Chapter 8 can handle duplicate key values unless noted otherwise.', 'When analyzing sorting algorithms, it is traditional to measure the number of comparisons made between keys. This measure is usually closely related to the running time for the algorithm and has the advantage of being machine and data- type independent. However, in some cases records might be so large that their physical movement might take a signiﬁcant fraction of the total running time. If so, it might be appropriate to measure the number of swap operations performed by the algorithm. In most applications we can assume that all records and keys are of ﬁxed length, and that a single comparison or a single swap operation requires a constant amount of time regardless of which keys are involved. Some special situations “change the rules” for comparing sorting algorithms. For example, an application with records or keys having widely varying length (such as sorting a sequence of variable length strings) will beneﬁt from a special-purpose sorting technique. Some applications require that a small number of records be sorted, but that the sort be performed frequently. An example would be an application that repeatedly sorts groups of ﬁve numbers. In such cases, the constants in the runtime equations that are usually ignored in an asymptotic analysis now become crucial. Finally, some situations require that a sorting algorithm use as little memory as possible. We will note which sorting algorithms require signiﬁcant extra memory beyond the input array.', '15.18 Write the complete algorithm for the merge insert sort sketched out in Sec- 3tion 15.7. 315.19 Here is a suggestion for what might be a truly optimal sorting algorithm. Pick the best set of comparisons for input lists of size 2. Then pick the best set of comparisons for size 3, size 4, size 5, and so on. Combine them together into one program with a big case statement. Is this an algorithm? 3Sec. 15.10 Projects 315.10 Projects', 'A simple estimate for a problem’s lower bound can be obtained by measuring the size of the input that must be read and the output that must be written. Certainly no algorithm can be more efﬁcient than the problem’s I/O time. From this we see that the sorting problem cannot be solved by any algorithm in less than Ω(n) time because it takes at least n steps to read and write the n values to be sorted. Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order. So, based on our current knowledge of sorting algorithms and the size of the input, we know that the problem of sorting is bounded by Ω(n) and O(n log n).', 'If you tried solving these examples, you probably found yourself doing a lot of trial-and-error and a lot of backtracking. To come up with an algorithm, we want an organized way to go through the possible subsets. Is there a way to make the problem smaller, so that we can apply divide and conquer? We essentially have two parts to the input: The knapsack size K and the n items. It probably will not do us much good to try and break the knapsack into pieces and solve the sub-pieces (since we already saw that knowing the answer for a knapsack of size 163 did nothing to help us solve the problem for a knapsack of size 164).', 'We can solve this version of the problem in polynomial time with a non-deter- ministic computer. The non-deterministic algorithm simply checks all of the pos- sible subsets of edges in the graph, in parallel. If any subset of the edges is an appropriate cycle of total length less than or equal to k, the answer is YES; oth- erwise the answer is NO. Note that it is only necessary that some subset meet the requirement; it does not matter how many subsets fail. Checking a particular sub- set is done in polynomial time by adding the distances of the edges and verifying that the edges form a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. Thus, the checking algorithm runs in polynomial time. Unfortunately, there are 2|E| subsets to check,', 'that can tell, in constant time, whether piece a connects to piece b on a’s side ad and b’s opposite side bd. The input to your algorithm should consist of an n × m array of random pieces, along with dimensions n and m. The algorithm should put the pieces in their correct positions in the array. Your algorithm should be as efﬁcient as possible in the asymptotic sense. Write a summation for the running time of your algorithm on n pieces, and then derive a closed-form solution for the summation.']

Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order.

                Context: ['A simple improvement might then be to replace Quicksort with a faster sort for small numbers, say Insertion Sort or Selection Sort. However, there is an even better — and still simpler — optimization. When Quicksort partitions are below a certain size, do nothing! The values within that partition will be out of order. However, we do know that all values in the array to the left of the partition are smaller than all values in the partition. All values in the array to the right of the partition are greater than all values in the partition. Thus, even if Quicksort only gets the values to “nearly” the right locations, the array will be close to sorted. This is an ideal situation in which to take advantage of the best-case performance of Insertion Sort. The ﬁnal step is a single call to Insertion Sort to process the entire array, putting the elements into ﬁnal sorted order. Empirical testing shows that the subarrays should be left unordered whenever they get down to nine or fewer elements.', 'Quicksort is aptly named because, when properly implemented, it is the fastest known general-purpose in-memory sorting algorithm in the average case. It does not require the extra array needed by Mergesort, so it is space efﬁcient as well. Quicksort is widely used, and is typically the algorithm implemented in a library sort routine such as the UNIX qsort function. Interestingly, Quicksort is ham- pered by exceedingly poor worst-case performance, thus making it inappropriate for certain applications.', '257 3258 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 37.2 Write an Insertion Sort algorithm for integer key values. However, here’s the catch: The input is a stack (not an array), and the only variables that your algorithm may use are a ﬁxed number of integers and a ﬁxed number of stacks. The algorithm should return a stack containing the records in sorted order (with the least value being at the top of the stack). Your algorithm should be Θ(n2) in the worst case.', '2The worst insult that I can think of for a sorting algorithm. 3Sec. 7.5 Quicksort 3is still unlikely to happen. It does not take many good partitionings for Quicksort to work fairly well.', '287 3288 3Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting 3in one pass with an internal sort. These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records. Using an internal sort to create initial runs of 512 records reduces this to one initial pass to create the runs and nine merge passes to put them all together, approximately half as many passes.', 'These ﬁgures show a number of interesting results. As expected, the O(n2) sorts are quite poor performers for large arrays. Insertion Sort is by far the best of this group, unless the array is already reverse sorted. Shellsort is clearly superior to any of these O(n2) sorts for lists of even 100 elements. Optimized Quicksort is clearly the best overall algorithm for all but lists of 10 elements. Even for small arrays, optimized Quicksort performs well because it does one partition step be- fore calling Insertion Sort. Compared to the other O(n log n) sorts, unoptimized Heapsort is quite slow due to the overhead of the class structure. When all of this is stripped away and the algorithm is implemented to manipulate an array directly, it is still somewhat slower than mergesort. In general, optimizing the various algo- rithms makes a noticeable improvement for larger array sizes.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', 'm1 + (m2 + m1) = Θ(m1 + m2). 3A similar argument was used in our analysis for the partition function in the Quicksort algorithm (Section 7.5). While on any given pass through the while loop the left or right pointers might move all the way through the remainder of the 3477 3478 3Chap. 14 Analysis Techniques 3partition, doing so would reduce the number of times that the while loop can be further executed.', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 3The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice.', 'Our discussion of Quicksort began by considering the practicality of using a binary search tree for sorting. The BST requires more space than the other sorting meth- ods and will be slower than Quicksort or Mergesort due to the relative expense of inserting values into the tree. There is also the possibility that the BST might be un- balanced, leading to a Θ(n2) worst-case running time. Subtree balance in the BST is closely related to Quicksort’s partition step. Quicksort’s pivot serves roughly the same purpose as the BST root value in that the left partition (subtree) stores val- ues less than the pivot (root) value, while the right partition (subtree) stores values greater than or equal to the pivot (root).', 'where the pivot is the least value in that partition.

For example, Insertion Sort sequentially compares the value to be inserted into the sorted list until a comparison against the next value in the list fails. In contrast, Radix Sort has no direct comparison of key values. All decisions are based on the value of speciﬁc digits in the key value, so it is possible to take approaches to sorting that do not involve key comparisons. Of course, Radix Sort in the end does not provide a more efﬁcient sorting algorithm than comparison-based sorting. Thus, empirical evidence suggests that comparison-based sorting is a good approach.3', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements.

Pick the best set of comparisons for input lists of size 2. Then pick the best set of comparisons for size 3, size 4, size 5, and so on. Combine them together into one program with a big case statement. Is this an algorithm? 3Sec. 15.10 Projects 315.10 Projects', 'A simple estimate for a problem’s lower bound can be obtained by measuring the size of the input that must be read and the output that must be written. Certainly no algorithm can be more efﬁcient than the problem’s I/O time. From this we see that the sorting problem cannot be solved by any algorithm in less than Ω(n) time because it takes at least n steps to read and write the n values to be sorted. Alter- natively, any sorting algorithm must at least look at every input vale to recognize whether the input values are in sort order. So, based on our current knowledge of sorting algorithms and the size of the input, we know that the problem of sorting is bounded by Ω(n) and O(n log n).', 'If you tried solving these examples, you probably found yourself doing a lot of trial-and-error and a lot of backtracking. To come up with an algorithm, we want an organized way to go through the possible subsets. Is there a way to make the problem smaller, so that we can apply divide and conquer? We essentially have two parts to the input: The knapsack size K and the n items. It probably will not do us much good to try and break the knapsack into pieces and solve the sub-pieces (since we already saw that knowing the answer for a knapsack of size 163 did nothing to help us solve the problem for a knapsack of size 164).', 'We can solve this version of the problem in polynomial time with a non-deter- ministic computer. The non-deterministic algorithm simply checks all of the pos- sible subsets of edges in the graph, in parallel. If any subset of the edges is an appropriate cycle of total length less than or equal to k, the answer is YES; oth- erwise the answer is NO. Note that it is only necessary that some subset meet the requirement; it does not matter how many subsets fail. Checking a particular sub- set is done in polynomial time by adding the distances of the edges and verifying that the edges form a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. Thus, the checking algorithm runs in polynomial time. Unfortunately, there are 2|E| subsets to check,', 'that can tell, in constant time, whether piece a connects to piece b on a’s side ad and b’s opposite side bd. The input to your algorithm should consist of an n × m array of random pieces, along with dimensions n and m. The algorithm should put the pieces in their correct positions in the array. Your algorithm should be as efﬁcient as possible in the asymptotic sense. Write a summation for the running time of your algorithm on n pieces, and then derive a closed-form solution for the summation.']

The first six nodes are relevant, discussing concepts like 'Replacement Selection,' 'Mergesort,' 'Sequential Access,' and 'Multiway Merging,' which are directly related to the input. However, the seventh node, which is about 'special-purpose sorting applications,' is not directly relevant and should be ranked lower.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer.

For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9585576040121495 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.96 because most relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. However, the eighth node, which 'primarily discusses binary trees and does not directly relate to the key concepts of searching algorithms', is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. Additionally, the twelfth node, which 'is a glossary of terms and does not directly discuss searching concepts', and the fourteenth node, which 'is about binary search trees, which is not directly related to the key concepts of searching algorithms', are also ranked higher than they should be. Despite these issues, the majority of relevant nodes are correctly prioritized, contributing to the high score.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'If we know nothing about the distribution of key values, then binary search is the best algorithm available for searching a sorted array (see Exercise 9.22). However, sometimes we do know something about the expected key distribution. Consider the typical behavior of a person looking up a word in a large dictionary. Most people certainly do not use sequential search! Typically, people use a mod- iﬁed form of binary search, at least until they get close to the word that they are looking for. The search generally does not start at the middle of the dictionary. A person looking for a word starting with ‘S’ generally assumes that entries beginning with ‘S’ start about three quarters of the way through the dictionary. Thus, he or', '3.2 Implement sequential search and binary search algorithms on your computer. Run timings for each algorithm on arrays of size n = 10i for i ranging from 1 to as large a value as your computer’s memory and compiler will allow. For both algorithms, store the values 0 through n − 1 in order in the array, and use a variety of random search values in the range 0 to n − 1 on each size n. Graph the resulting times. When is sequential search faster than binary search for a sorted array?', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Indexing. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', 'Consider a large database of employee records. If the primary key is the em- ployee’s ID number and the secondary key is the employee’s name, then each record in the name index associates a name with one or more ID numbers. The ID number index in turn associates an ID number with a unique pointer to the full record on disk. The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record. It is called a list because each secondary key value has (conceptually) a list of primary keys as- sociated with it. Figure 10.4 illustrates this arrangement. Here, we have last names as the secondary key. The primary key is a four-character unique identiﬁer.', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Some databases require support for multiple keys. In other words, records can be searched for using any one of several key ﬁelds, such as name or ID number. Typically, each such key has its own one-dimensional index, and any given search query searches one of these independent indices as appropriate.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'In their most general form, database applications have the following character- 3istics: 31. Large sets of records that are frequently updated. 2. Search is by one or a combination of several keys. 3. Key range queries or min/max queries are used.', 'An application using the UNION/FIND operations should store a set of n ob- jects, where each object is assigned a unique index in the range 0 to n − 1.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Indexing. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', 'Consider a large database of employee records. If the primary key is the em- ployee’s ID number and the secondary key is the employee’s name, then each record in the name index associates a name with one or more ID numbers. The ID number index in turn associates an ID number with a unique pointer to the full record on disk. The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record. It is called a list because each secondary key value has (conceptually) a list of primary keys as- sociated with it. Figure 10.4 illustrates this arrangement. Here, we have last names as the secondary key. The primary key is a four-character unique identiﬁer.', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Some databases require support for multiple keys. In other words, records can be searched for using any one of several key ﬁelds, such as name or ID number. Typically, each such key has its own one-dimensional index, and any given search query searches one of these independent indices as appropriate.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'In their most general form, database applications have the following character- 3istics: 31. Large sets of records that are frequently updated. 2.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9034013605442176 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.90 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'linear index' and its advantages, which is directly relevant, while the sixth node, which is less relevant, discusses 'multiple keys' and 'one-dimensional index', not directly referenced in the expected output. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the eighth node discussing general characteristics of database applications, are ranked higher than they should be compared to relevant nodes.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Indexing. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', 'Consider a large database of employee records. If the primary key is the em- ployee’s ID number and the secondary key is the employee’s name, then each record in the name index associates a name with one or more ID numbers. The ID number index in turn associates an ID number with a unique pointer to the full record on disk. The secondary key index in such an organization is also known as an inverted list or inverted ﬁle. It is inverted in that searches work backwards from the secondary key to the primary key to the actual data record. It is called a list because each secondary key value has (conceptually) a list of primary keys as- sociated with it. Figure 10.4 illustrates this arrangement. Here, we have last names as the secondary key. The primary key is a four-character unique identiﬁer.', 'Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'Some databases require support for multiple keys. In other words, records can be searched for using any one of several key ﬁelds, such as name or ID number. Typically, each such key has its own one-dimensional index, and any given search query searches one of these independent indices as appropriate.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'In their most general form, database applications have the following character- 3istics: 31. Large sets of records that are frequently updated. 2.

Section 11.2 presents a graph ADT and simple implementations based on the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Both the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list can be used to store directed or undirected graphs. Each edge of an undirected graph connecting Vertices U and V is represented by two directed edges: one from U to V and one from V to U. Figure 11.4 illustrates the use of the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list for undirected graphs.', 'Which graph representation is more space efﬁcient depends on the number of edges in the graph. The adjacency list stores information only for those edges that actually appear in the graph, while the adjacency matrix requires space for each potential edge, whether it exists or not. However, the adjacency matrix requires no overhead for pointers, which can be a substantial cost, especially if the only 3Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432', 'information stored for an edge is one bit to indicate its existence.

Sparse graphs are likely to have their adjacency list representation be more space efﬁcient.', '377 3378 3Chap. 11 Graphs 3It is reasonably straightforward to implement our graph and edge ADTs using either the adjacency list or adjacency matrix. The sample implementations pre- sented here do not address the issue of how the graph is actually created. The user of these implementations must add functionality for this purpose, perhaps reading the graph description from a ﬁle. The graph can be built up by using the setEdge function provided by the ADT.', 'Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432 3Figure 11.4 Using the graph representations for undirected graphs.

An alternative would be to store only a single undirected edge (I, J) to connect Vertices I and J. However, what if the user asks for edge (J, I)? We can solve this problem by consistently storing the edge such that the lesser of I and J always comes ﬁrst. Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5.

REASON: The score is 0.79 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are generally ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node provides an 'overview of key concepts such as graph terminology, representations, ADT, traversal algorithms, shortest routes, and minimum-cost spanning trees', which are directly relevant to the expected output. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the fourth node, which 'focuses on space efficiency of graph representations without introducing new key concepts or terminology', are ranked higher than some relevant nodes. Additionally, the sixth node, which 'provides a visual representation of graphs but does not introduce new key concepts or terminology', is ranked above more relevant nodes.

Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Both the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list can be used to store directed or undirected graphs. Each edge of an undirected graph connecting Vertices U and V is represented by two directed edges: one from U to V and one from V to U. Figure 11.4 illustrates the use of the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list for undirected graphs.', 'Which graph representation is more space efﬁcient depends on the number of edges in the graph. The adjacency list stores information only for those edges that actually appear in the graph, while the adjacency matrix requires space for each potential edge, whether it exists or not.

An alternative would be to store only a single undirected edge (I, J) to connect Vertices I and J. However, what if the user asks for edge (J, I)? We can solve this problem by consistently storing the edge such that the lesser of I and J always comes ﬁrst. Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we notice that only the lower triangle of the array is used.

For Dijkstra’s shortest paths algorithm, two different implementations were given in Sec- tion 11.4.1 that provide different ways for determining the next closest vertex at each iteration of the algorithm. The relative costs of these two variants depend on who sparse or dense the graph is. They might also depend on whether the graph is implemented using an adjacency list or adjacency ma- trix. Design and implement a study to compare the effects on performance for three variables: (i) the two graph representations (adjacency list and adja- cency matrix); (ii) the two implementations for Djikstra’s shortest paths alg- orithm (searching the table of vertex distances or using a priority queue to track the distances), and (iii) sparse versus dense graphs.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists and Arrays Revisited. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.09090909090909091 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.09 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'sublists', is ranked 11th. This is lower than many irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing the AList class and its properties, which does not mention expected output concepts like 'Multilists' or 'Memory Management'.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists and Arrays Revisited. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', '16.7 If we had a linked list that would never be modiﬁed, we can use a simpler approach than the Skip List to speed access. The concept would remain the same in that we add additional pointers to list nodes for efﬁcient access to the ith element. How can we add a second pointer to each element of a singly linked list to allow access to an arbitrary element in O(log n) time? 16.8 What is the expected (average) number of pointers for a Skip List node? 16.9 Write a function to remove a node with given value from a Skip List. 16.10 Write a function to ﬁnd the ith node on a Skip List.', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list.

REASON: The score is 0.93 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses AVL trees and their balance property, which is directly relevant, while the eighth node focuses on specific AVL tree operations without introducing new concepts relevant to the expected output. Similarly, the second node mentions balanced tree data structures, which are key concepts, whereas the ninth node discusses binary trees and their properties, which are not directly related to the advanced tree structures. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, like the eighth node, are ranked higher than they should be.

Call the new tree T(cid:48). All nodes originally in T will be internal nodes in T(cid:48) (because even the leaf nodes of T have children in T(cid:48)). T(cid:48) is a full binary tree, because every internal node of T now must have two children in T(cid:48), and each leaf node in T must have two children in T(cid:48) (the leaves just added). The Full Binary Tree Theorem tells us that the number of leaves in a full binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes. Thus, the number of new leaves that were added to create T(cid:48) is one more than the number of nodes in T. Each leaf node in T(cid:48) corresponds to an empty subtree in T. Thus, the number of empty subtrees in T is one more than (cid:50) the number of nodes in T.']

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem).

Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered.

If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known.

However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case.

Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', 'Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction 33 Algorithm Analysis 33.1 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 3.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm? 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 3Introduction 33.4.1 Upper Bounds 3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3.4.3 Θ Notation 3.4.4 3.4.5 Classifying Functions 3Simplifying Rules', '7.22 Use an argument similar to that given in Section 7.9 to prove that log n is a worst-case lower bound for the problem of searching for a given value in a sorted array containing n elements.', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', 'Much of the material in this book is also covered in many other textbooks on data structures and algorithms. The biggest exception is that not many other textbooks cover lower bounds proofs in any signiﬁcant detail, as is done in this chapter. Those that do focus on the same example problems (search and selection) because it tells such a tight and compelling story regarding related topics, while showing off the major techniques for lower bounds proofs. Two examples of such textbooks are “Computer Algorithms” by Baase and Van Gelder [BG00], and “Compared to What?” by Gregory J.E. Rawlins [Raw92]. “Fundamentals of Algorithmics” by Brassard and Bratley [BB96] also covers lower bounds proofs.', 'then stop, else if the problem deﬁnition focuses on the wrong thing, 3then restate it, else if the algorithm is too slow, then ﬁnd a faster algorithm, else if lower bound is too weak, 3then generate a stronger bound. 3We can repeat this process until we are satisﬁed or exhausted.']

REASON: The score is 0.08 because the relevant node in the retrieval context, which mentions 'Patterns of Algorithms' and includes 'Dynamic Programming', 'Randomized Algorithms', and 'Numerical Algorithms', is ranked 13th. This is much lower than many irrelevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'implementing and timing search algorithms', which is not directly related to the expected output about dynamic programming and other algorithmic patterns. Additionally, the second node about 'graph traversal and the visitor design pattern' and the third node about 'breadth-first search' are also ranked higher than the relevant node, contributing to the low score.

The strategy design pattern is focused on encapsulating an activity that is part of a larger process, so 315 316 3Chap. 1 Data Structures and Algorithms', 'One of the biggest challenges to understanding design patterns is that some- times one is only subtly different from another. For example, you might be con- fused about the difference between the composite pattern and the visitor pattern. The distinction is that the composite design pattern is about whether to give control of the traversal process to the nodes of the tree or to the tree itself. Both approaches can make use of the visitor design pattern to avoid rewriting the traversal function many times, by encapsulating the activity performed at each node.', 'Sec. 5.9 Projects 3trees is that operations such as inorder traversal can be implemented without using recursion or a stack.

A detailed example for using the Composite design pattern is presented in Section 5.3.1. 31.3.4 Strategy', 'The Strategy design pattern can be used to create generalized sorting functions. The sorting function can be called with an additional parameter. This parameter is a class that understands how to extract and compare the key values for records to be sorted. In this way, the sorting function does not need to know any details of how its record type is implemented.', '16 Patterns of Algorithms 316.1 Dynamic Programming 316.1.1 The Knapsack Problem 16.1.2 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 316.2 Randomized Algorithms 316.2.1 Randomized algorithms for ﬁnding large values 16.2.2 Skip Lists 16.3 Numerical Algorithms 16.3.1 Exponentiation 16.3.2 Largest Common Factor 16.3.3 Matrix Multiplication 16.3.4 Random Numbers 16.3.5 The Fast Fourier Transform 316.4 Further Reading 16.5 Exercises 16.6 Projects 317 Limits to Computation 317.1 Reductions 17.2 Hard Problems', 'We could write a separate traversal function for each such activity that we in- tend to perform on the tree.

REASON: The score is 0.96 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first seven nodes discuss key concepts like 'Reductions', 'Hard Problems', 'N P-Completeness', and the 'Halting Problem', which are directly related to the input. However, the eighth node, which is a bibliography entry and not relevant, is ranked higher than some relevant nodes. Additionally, the thirteenth node, which discusses general concepts of problems, algorithms, and programs, is not directly relevant and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes. Despite these few misplacements, the overall ranking is quite accurate, leading to a high score.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Recall ---> SCORE: 0.4117647058823529 ---> FAILURE

REASON: The score is 0.41 because while several terms like 'Reductions', 'Hard Problems', 'NP-Completeness', 'Turing Machines', 'Impossible Problems', 'Halting Problem', and 'Uncountability' are supported by nodes in the retrieval context, many other terms such as 'NP-Complete Problems', 'NP-Hard Problems', 'Pseudo Polynomial Time Algorithms', 'Banch and Bound', 'Optimization Problems', 'Collatz Sequence', 'Computability', 'Countable Sets', 'Uncountable Sets', and 'Function Tables' are not found in any node, leading to a lower score.

This comes as a result of the fact that the Halting Problem is unsolvable. 317.3.1 Uncountability 3Before proving that the Halting Problem is unsolvable, we ﬁrst prove that not all functions can be implemented as a computer program. This must be so because the number of programs is much smaller than the number of possible functions.', 'Sec. 17.3 Impossible Problems 317.3.2 The Halting Problem Is Unsolvable 3While there might be intellectual appeal to knowing that there exists some function that cannot be computed by a computer program, does this mean that there is any such useful function? After all, does it really matter if no program can compute a “nonsense” function such as shown in Bin 4 of Figure 17.7? Now we will prove that the Halting Problem cannot be computed by any computer program. The proof is by contradiction.', '559 3560 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3that is, it halts. Thus, contrary does the contrary of what halt says that it will do. 3The action of contrary is logically inconsistent with the assumption that halt solves the Halting Problem correctly. There are no other assumptions we made that might cause this inconsistency. Thus, by contradiction, we have proved that halt cannot solve the Halting Problem correctly, and thus there is no program that can solve the Halting Problem.', '17.4 Further Reading 3The classic text on the theory of N P-completeness is Computers and Intractabil- ity: A Guide to the Theory of N P-completeness by Garey and Johnston [GJ79]. The Traveling Salesman Problem, edited by Lawler et al. [LLKS85], discusses 3561 3562 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3many approaches to ﬁnding an acceptable solution to this particular N P-complete problem in a reasonable amount of time.', 'The theory of N P-completeness gives a technique for separating tractable from (probably) intractable problems. Recalling the algorithm for generating algorithms in Section 15.1, we can reﬁne it for problems that we suspect are N P-complete. When faced with a new problem, we might alternate between checking if it is tractable (that is, we try to ﬁnd a polynomial-time solution) and checking if it is intractable (we try to prove the problem is N P-complete). While proving that some problem is N P-complete does not actually make our upper bound for our', 'So a crucial ﬁrst step to getting this whole theory off the ground is ﬁnding one problem that is N P-hard. The ﬁrst proof that a problem is N P-hard (and because it is in N P, therefore N P-complete) was done by Stephen Cook. For this feat, Cook won the ﬁrst Turing award, which is the closest Computer Science equivalent to the Nobel Prize. The “grand-daddy” N P-complete problem that Cook used is call SATISFIABILITY (or SAT for short).', '[FL95] 3[Fla05] 3[FZ98] 3BIBLIOGRAPHY 3[GI91] 3[GJ79] 3Zvi Galil and Giuseppe F. Italiano.

Sometimes an N P-completeness proof involves a transformation between types of inputs, as shown next. Theorem 17.3 K-CLIQUE is N P-complete. Proof: K-CLIQUE is in N P, because we can just guess a collection of k vertices and test in polynomial time if it is a clique. Now we show that K- CLIQUE is N P-hard by using a reduction from SAT. An instance of SAT is a Boolean expression', 'For the rest of this chapter, we deﬁne a hard algorithm to be one that runs in exponential time, that is, in Ω(cn) for some constant c > 1. A deﬁnition for a hard problem will be presented in the next section. 317.2.1 The Theory of N P-Completeness', 'Turing machines are a simple model of computation for writing programs that are language acceptors. There is a “universal” Turing machine that can take as in- put a description for a Turing machine, and an input string, and return the execution of that machine on that string. This Turing machine in turn can be cast as a Boolean expression such that the expression is satisﬁable if and only if the Turing machine yields ACCEPT for that string. Cook used Turing machines in his proof because they are simple enough that he could develop this transformation of Turing ma- chines to Boolean expressions, but rich enough to be able to compute any function that a regular computer can compute. The signiﬁcance of this transformation is that any decision problem that is performable by the Turing machine is transformable to SAT. Thus, SAT is N P-hard.', '1.4 Problems, Algorithms, and Programs 3Programmers commonly deal with problems, algorithms, and computer programs.
