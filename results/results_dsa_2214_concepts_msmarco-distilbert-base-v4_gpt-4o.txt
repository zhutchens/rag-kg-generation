REASON: The actual output lists specific data structures and concepts like Linked Lists and Binary Search Trees, which are present in the context, but it does not align with the expected output that focuses on broader concepts like Data Structures and Algorithms. The actual output lacks the necessary information on algorithm efficiency and abstract data types, and introduces extraneous information not required by the expected output.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9415404040404042 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.94 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'linked lists, which are a fundamental data structure', and the second node mentions 'ADTs, stacks, queues, and binary search trees', all of which are key concepts in data structures and algorithms. However, the seventh node, which is focused on 'a specific implementation detail of a linked list node', is ranked higher than some relevant nodes, such as the eighth node that mentions 'Binary Search Trees, a key data structure'. Similarly, the tenth node, which is 'a detailed comparison of binary search and QBS', is ranked higher than the eleventh node that covers 'graph terminology and traversals, important concepts in data structures and algorithms'. These instances of irrelevant nodes being ranked higher than relevant ones prevent the score from being perfect.

Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made.

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first three nodes are relevant as they discuss 'Sets and Relations', 'Set Notation', and 'Logarithms', which are directly related to the expected output concepts. The irrelevant nodes, starting from the fourth node, discuss topics such as 'Problems, Algorithms, and Programs', 'random number generation', and 'hashing and indexing', which do not relate to the expected output concepts.

                Context: ['7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and fundamental tech- niques of algorithm analysis. We focus on a methodology known as asymptotic algorithm analysis, or simply asymptotic analysis. Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource consumption of an algorithm. It allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more algorithms for solving the same problem. Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource constraints for a problem before they imple- ment an actual program. After reading this chapter, you should understand', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', 'Simplifying Rules 33.5 Calculating the Running Time for a Program 3.6 Analyzing Problems 3.7 Common Misunderstandings 3.8 Multiple Parameters 3.9 Space Bounds 3.10 Speeding Up Your Programs 3.11 Empirical Analysis 3.12 Further Reading 3.13 Exercises 3.14 Projects 3II Fundamental Data Structures 34 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists 34.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 4.1.2 Linked Lists 4.1.3 Comparison of List Implementations 3Contents 337 37 38 44 45 46', 'Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction 33 Algorithm Analysis 33.1 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 3.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm? 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 3Introduction 33.4.1 Upper Bounds 3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3.4.3 Θ Notation 3.4.4 3.4.5 Classifying Functions 3Simplifying Rules', '3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3Big-Oh notation describes an upper bound.

                Context: ['7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting', 'This chapter introduces the motivation, basic notation, and fundamental tech- niques of algorithm analysis. We focus on a methodology known as asymptotic algorithm analysis, or simply asymptotic analysis. Asymptotic analysis attempts to estimate the resource consumption of an algorithm. It allows us to compare the relative costs of two or more algorithms for solving the same problem. Asymptotic analysis also gives algorithm designers a tool for estimating whether a proposed solution is likely to meet the resource constraints for a problem before they imple- ment an actual program. After reading this chapter, you should understand', '3.4.4 Simplifying Rules 3Once you determine the running-time equation for an algorithm, it really is a simple matter to derive the big-Oh, Ω, and Θ expressions from the equation. You do not need to resort to the formal deﬁnitions of asymptotic analysis. Instead, you can use the following rules to determine the simplest form.', '73 374 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 33.6 Analyzing Problems 3You most often use the techniques of “algorithm” analysis to analyze an algorithm, or the instantiation of an algorithm as a program. You can also use these same techniques to analyze the cost of a problem. It should make sense to you to say that the upper bound for a problem cannot be worse than the upper bound for the best algorithm that we know for that problem. But what does it mean to give a lower bound for a problem?', 'When you buy a faster computer or a faster compiler, the new problem size that can be run in a given amount of time for a given growth rate is larger by the same factor, regardless of the constant on the running-time equation. The time curves for two algorithms with different growth rates still cross, regardless of their running-time equation constants. For these reasons, we usually ignore the con- stants when we want an estimate of the growth rate for the running time or other resource requirements of an algorithm. This simpliﬁes the analysis and keeps us thinking about the most important aspect: the growth rate. This is called asymp- totic algorithm analysis. To be precise, asymptotic analysis refers to the study of an algorithm as the input size “gets big” or reaches a limit (in the calculus sense). However, it has proved to be so useful to ignore all constant factors that asymptotic analysis is used for most algorithm comparisons.', 'Simplifying Rules 33.5 Calculating the Running Time for a Program 3.6 Analyzing Problems 3.7 Common Misunderstandings 3.8 Multiple Parameters 3.9 Space Bounds 3.10 Speeding Up Your Programs 3.11 Empirical Analysis 3.12 Further Reading 3.13 Exercises 3.14 Projects 3II Fundamental Data Structures 34 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 34.1 Lists 34.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 4.1.2 Linked Lists 4.1.3 Comparison of List Implementations 3Contents 337 37 38 44 45 46', 'Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction 33 Algorithm Analysis 33.1 3.2 Best, Worst, and Average Cases 3.3 A Faster Computer, or a Faster Algorithm? 3.4 Asymptotic Analysis 3Introduction 33.4.1 Upper Bounds 3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3.4.3 Θ Notation 3.4.4 3.4.5 Classifying Functions 3Simplifying Rules', '3.4.2 Lower Bounds 3Big-Oh notation describes an upper bound.

CHAPTER: Data Structures and AlgorithmsContextual Precision ---> SCORE: 0.9253626450580235 ---> SUCCESS

REASON: The score is 0.93 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms' and 'asymptotic complexity analysis', which are directly related to the input. However, the ninth node, which is a mathematical exercise and does not directly relate to the key concepts of algorithm analysis, is ranked lower. Similarly, the eleventh node, which is an index and does not provide specific information related to the key concepts, is also ranked lower. This ranking ensures that relevant information is prioritized, but the presence of a few irrelevant nodes prevents a perfect score.

                Context: ['Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses. Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed. Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer. They called the stack a “LIFO” list, which stands for “Last-In, First- Out.” Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.', 'The stack is a list-like structure in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end. While this restriction makes stacks less ﬂexible than lists, it also makes stacks both efﬁcient (for those operations they can do) and easy to im- plement. Many applications require only the limited form of insert and remove operations that stacks provide. In such cases, it is more efﬁcient to use the sim- pler stack data structure rather than the generic list. For example, the freelist of Section 4.1.2 is really a stack.', 'list node class is that it can be reused by the linked implementations for the stack and queue data structures presented later in this chapter. Figure 4.4 shows the implementation for list nodes, called the Link class. Objects in the Link class contain an element ﬁeld to store the element value, and a next ﬁeld to store a pointer to the next node on the list. The list built from such nodes is called a singly linked list, or a one-way list, because each list node has a single pointer to the next node on the list.', 'Like the stack, the queue is a list-like structure that provides restricted access to its elements. Queue elements may only be inserted at the back (called an enqueue operation) and removed from the front (called a dequeue operation). Queues oper- ate like standing in line at a movie theater ticket counter.1 If nobody cheats, then newcomers go to the back of the line. The person at the front of the line is the next to be served. Thus, queues release their elements in order of arrival. Accountants have used queues since long before the existence of computers. They call a queue a “FIFO” list, which stands for “First-In, First-Out.” Figure 4.24 shows a sample queue ADT. This section presents two implementations for queues: the array-based queue and the linked queue.', '117 3118 3Chap. 4 Lists, Stacks, and Queues 3/** Stack ADT */ public interface Stack<E> { 3/** Reinitialize the stack. 3The user is responsible for 3reclaiming the storage used by the stack elements. */ 3public void clear(); 3/** Push an element onto the top of the stack. 3@param it The element being pushed onto the stack. */ 3public void push(E it); 3/** Remove and return the element at the top of the stack. 3@return The element at the top of the stack. */ 3public E pop();', 'In the most general sense, a data structure is any data representation and its associated operations. Even an integer or ﬂoating point number stored on the com- puter can be viewed as a simple data structure. More commonly, people use the term “data structure” to mean an organization or structuring for a collection of data items. A sorted list of integers stored in an array is an example of such a structuring. 3Sec. 1.1 A Philosophy of Data Structures', '4.1.2 Linked Lists 3The second traditional approach to implementing lists makes use of pointers and is usually called a linked list. The linked list uses dynamic memory allocation, that is, it allocates memory for new list elements as needed. 3A linked list is made up of a series of objects, called the nodes of the list.

For general trees, preorder and postorder traversals are deﬁned with meanings similar to their binary tree counterparts.

Equivalent theo- rems to those in Section 5.1.1 regarding the number of NULL pointers in a K-ary tree and the relationship between the number of leaves and the number of internal nodes in a K-ary tree can be derived.

This can easily be implemented as follows. 3/** @param rt is the root of the subtree */ void preorder(BinNode rt) {', '5.2 One way to deal with the “problem” of null pointers in binary trees is to use that space for some other purpose. One example is the threaded binary tree. Extending the node implementation of Figure 5.7, the threaded binary tree stores with each node two additional bit ﬁelds that indicate if the child pointers lc and rc are regular pointers to child nodes or threads. If lc is not a pointer to a non-empty child (i.e., if it would be null in a regular binary tree), then it instead stores a pointer to the inorder predecessor of that node.

REASON: The score is 0.30 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context, such as the seventh node discussing 'writing a postorder traversal function for general trees', the eighth node on 'a dynamic general tree representation', and the ninth node describing the 'left-child/right-sibling' implementation, are ranked lower than irrelevant nodes. The first six nodes, which focus on binary trees and their properties, are not directly related to non-binary trees and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.

Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved.

The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', '8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3The second stage of a typical external sorting algorithm merges the runs created by the ﬁrst stage.

Shell. It is also sometimes called the diminishing increment sort. Unlike Insertion and Selection Sort, there is no real life intuitive equivalent to Shell- sort. Unlike the exchange sorts, Shellsort makes comparisons and swaps between non-adjacent elements. Shellsort also exploits the best-case performance of Inser- tion Sort. Shellsort’s strategy is to make the list “mostly sorted” so that a ﬁnal Insertion Sort can ﬁnish the job. When properly implemented, Shellsort will give substantially better performance than Θ(n2) in the worst case.', 'Our next sorting algorithm is called Bubble Sort. Bubble Sort is often taught to novice programmers in introductory computer science courses. This is unfortunate, because Bubble Sort has no redeeming features whatsoever. It is a relatively slow sort, it is no easier to understand than Insertion Sort, it does not correspond to any intuitive counterpart in “everyday” use, and it has a poor best-case running time. However, Bubble Sort can serve as the inspiration for a better sorting algorithm that will be presented in Section 7.2.3.', '1There is a slight anomaly with Selection Sort. The supposed advantage for Selection Sort is its low number of swaps required, yet Selection Sort’s best-case number of swaps is worse than that for Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort. This is because the implementation given for Selection Sort does not avoid a swap in the case where record i is already in position i. One could put in a test to avoid swapping in this situation. But it usually takes more time to do the tests than would be saved by avoiding such swaps.', 'We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory. Because the records must reside in peripheral or external memory, such sorting methods are called external sorts. This is in contrast to the internal sorts discussed in Chapter 7 which assume that the records to be sorted are stored in main memory. Sorting large collections of records is central to many applications, such as processing payrolls and other large business databases. As a consequence, many external sorting algorithms have been devised. Years ago, sorting algorithm designers sought to optimize the use of speciﬁc hardware conﬁgurations, such as multiple tape or disk drives. Most computing today is done on personal computers and low-end workstations with relatively powerful CPUs, but only one or at most two disk drives. The techniques presented here are geared toward optimized pro- cessing on a single disk drive. This approach allows us to cover the most important issues in external sorting while skipping many less important machine-dependent details. Readers who have a need to implement efﬁcient external sorting algorithms that take advantage of more sophisticated hardware conﬁgurations should consult the references in Section 8.6.', 'Recall Insertion Sort, where we put element i into a sorted sublist of the ﬁrst i− 1 elements. What if we modify the standard Insertion Sort algorithm to use binary search to locate where the ith element goes in the sorted sublist? This algorithm is called binary insert sort. As a general-purpose sorting algorithm, this is not practical because we then have to (on average) move about i/2 elements to make room for the newly inserted element in the sorted sublist. But if we count only comparisons, binary insert sort is pretty good. And we can use some ideas from binary insert sort to get closer to an algorithm that uses the absolute minimum number of comparisons needed to sort.', '7.6 Recall that a sorting algorithm is said to be stable if the original ordering for duplicate keys is preserved. Of the sorting algorithms Insertion Sort, Bub- ble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort, Binsort, and Radix Sort, which of these are stable, and which are not?

Test your program both on ﬁles with small records and on ﬁles with large records. For what size record do you ﬁnd that key sorting would be worthwhile?', '7.4 The implementation for Mergesort given in Section 7.4 takes an array as in- put and sorts that array. At the beginning of Section 7.4 there is a simple pseudocode implementation for sorting a linked list using Mergesort. Im- plement both a linked list-based version of Mergesort and the array-based version of Mergesort, and compare their running times.', '7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms 3This section presents three simple sorting algorithms. While easy to understand and implement, we will soon see that they are unacceptably slow when there are many records to sort. Nonetheless, there are situations where one of these simple algorithms is the best tool for the job. 37.2.1 3Insertion Sort', 'n (cid:88) 3i ≈ n2/2 = Θ(n2). 3i=1 3Bubble Sort’s running time is roughly the same in the best, average, and worst cases. 3The number of swaps required depends on how often a value is less than the one immediately preceding it in the array. We can expect this to occur for about half the comparisons in the average case, leading to Θ(n2) for the expected number of swaps. The actual number of swaps performed by Bubble Sort will be identical to that performed by Insertion Sort.', '8.5.1 Simple Approaches to External Sorting', '7.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 3Which sorting algorithm is fastest? Asymptotic complexity analysis lets us distin- guish between Θ(n2) and Θ(n log n) algorithms, but it does not help distinguish between algorithms with the same asymptotic complexity. Nor does asymptotic analysis say anything about which algorithm is best for sorting small lists. For answers to these questions, we can turn to empirical testing. 3251 3252 3Chap. 7 Internal Sorting']

                Context: ['When processing records in a disk ﬁle, the order of access can have a great effect on I/O time. A random access procedure processes records in an order independent of their logical order within the ﬁle. Sequential access processes records in order of their logical appearance within the ﬁle. Sequential processing requires less seek time if the physical layout of the disk ﬁle matches its logical layout, as would be expected if the ﬁle were created on a disk with a high percentage of free space.', 'Replacement selection views RAM as consisting of an array of size M in ad- dition to an input buffer and an output buffer.

These runs can then be merged by Merge- sort. Standard Mergesort requires eighteen passes to process 256K records.

This will not happen if there is competition of any kind for the I/O head. For example, on a multi-user time-shared computer the sorting process might compete for the I/O head with the processes of other users. Even when the sorting process has sole control of the I/O head, it is still likely that sequential processing will not be efﬁcient. Imagine the situation where all processing is done on a single disk drive, with the typical arrangement of a single bank of read/write heads that move together over a stack of platters. If the sorting process involves reading from an input ﬁle, alternated with writing to an output ﬁle, then the I/O head will continuously seek between the input ﬁle and the output ﬁle. Similarly, if two input ﬁles are being processed simultaneously (such as during a merge process), then the I/O head will continuously seek between these two ﬁles.', 'We now consider the problem of sorting collections of records too large to ﬁt in main memory.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array.

QUERY: 
                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Searching. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['While binary search is indeed an optimal algorithm for a sorted list in the worst and average cases when searching a sorted array, there are a number of circum- stances that might lead us to select another algorithm instead. One possibility is that we know something about the distribution of the data in the array. We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1. Run your implementations over a large range of problem sizes, timing the results for each algorithm. Graph and compare these timing results. 3Sec. 9.7 Projects', '7.4 When implementing Insertion Sort, a binary search could be used to locate the position within the ﬁrst i − 1 elements of the array into which element i should be inserted.

REASON: The score is 0.64 because relevant nodes in the retrieval context are not consistently ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the second node, which is irrelevant as it 'focuses on database indexing and does not directly relate to the key concepts of searching algorithms', is ranked higher than the third node, which is relevant as it 'compares sequential search and binary search, which are relevant to the key concepts of searching algorithms'. However, the score is not lower because some relevant nodes, such as the first node discussing 'binary search, interpolation search, and linear search', are correctly ranked higher than irrelevant nodes.

We saw in Section 9.1 that if each position in L is equally likely to hold X (equivalently, the data are well distributed along the full key range), then an interpolation search is Θ(log log n) in the average case. If the data are not sorted, then using binary search requires us to pay the cost of sorting the list in advance, which is only worthwhile if many (at least O(log n)) searches will be performed on the list. Binary search also requires that the list (even if sorted) be implemented using an array or some other structure that supports random access to all elements with equal cost. Finally, if we know all search requests in advance, we might prefer to sort the list by frequency and do linear search in extreme search distributions, as discussed in Section 9.2.', 'If the database contains enough records, the linear index might be too large to store in main memory. This makes binary search of the index more expensive because many disk accesses would typically be required by the search process. One solution to this problem is to store a second-level linear index in main memory that indicates which disk block in the index ﬁle stores a desired key. For example, the linear index on disk might reside in a series of 1024-byte blocks. If each key/pointer pair in the linear index requires 8 bytes (a 4-byte key and a 4-byte pointer), then 128 key/pointer pairs are stored per block. The second-level index, stored in main memory, consists of a simple table storing the value of the key in the ﬁrst position of each block in the linear index ﬁle. This arrangement is shown in Figure 10.2. If the linear index requires 1024 disk blocks (1MB), the second-level index contains only 1024 entries, one per disk block. To ﬁnd which disk block contains a desired search key value, ﬁrst search through the 1024-entry table to ﬁnd the greatest value less than or equal to the search key. This directs the search to the proper block in the index ﬁle, which is then read into memory. At this point, a binary search within this block will produce a pointer to the actual record in the database. Because the', 'Function binary is designed to ﬁnd the (single) occurrence of K and return its position. A special value is returned if K does not appear in the array. This algorithm can be modiﬁed to implement variations such as returning the position of the ﬁrst occurrence of K in the array if multiple occurrences are allowed, and returning the position of the greatest value less than K when K is not in the array. Comparing sequential search to binary search, we see that as n grows, the Θ(n) running time for sequential search in the average and worst cases quickly becomes much greater than the Θ(log n) running time for binary search. Taken in isolation, binary search appears to be much more efﬁcient than sequential search. This is despite the fact that the constant factor for binary search is greater than that for sequential search, because the calculation for the next search position in binary search is more expensive than just incrementing the current position, as sequential search does.', 'Figure 3.4 An illustration of binary search on a sorted array of 16 positions. Consider a search for the position with value K = 45. Binary search ﬁrst checks the value at position 7. Because 41 < K, the desired value cannot appear in any position below 7 in the array. Next, binary search checks the value at position 11. Because 56 > K, the desired value (if it exists) must be between positions 7 and 11. Position 9 is checked next. Again, its value is too great. The ﬁnal search is at position 8, which contains the desired value. Thus, function binary returns position 8. Alternatively, if K were 44, then the same series of record accesses would be made. After checking position 8, binary would return a value of n, indicating that the search is unsuccessful.', '15.2.2 Searching in Sorted Lists 3We will now assume that list L is sorted. In this case, is linear search still optimal? Clearly no, but why not? Because we have additional information to work with that we do not have when the list is unsorted. We know that the standard binary search algorithm has a worst case cost of O(log n). Can we do better than this? We can prove that this is the best possible in the worst case with a proof similar to that used to show the lower bound on sorting.', '9.7 Projects 39.1 Implement a binary search and the quadratic binary search of Section 9.1. Run your implementations over a large range of problem sizes, timing the results for each algorithm. Graph and compare these timing results. 3Sec. 9.7 Projects', '7.4 When implementing Insertion Sort, a binary search could be used to locate the position within the ﬁrst i − 1 elements of the array into which element i should be inserted. How would this affect the number of comparisons re- quired? How would using such a binary search affect the asymptotic running time for Insertion Sort?', '4.4 Dictionaries 4.5 Further Reading 4.6 Exercises 4.7 Projects 35 Binary Trees 35.1 Deﬁnitions and Properties 35.1.1 The Full Binary Tree Theorem 5.1.2 A Binary Tree Node ADT 35.2 Binary Tree Traversals 5.3 Binary Tree Node Implementations 35.3.1 5.3.2 5.3.3 Array Implementation for Complete Binary Trees 3Pointer-Based Node Implementations Space Requirements 35.4 Binary Search Trees 5.5 Heaps and Priority Queues 5.6 Huffman Coding Trees', 'Factor 3lg n − 1 n 3 16 7 256 64K 15 232 31 32.4 lg lg n Diﬀerence 4.8 7.2 9.6 12 3worse ≈ same 1.6 2.6 3But we still are not done. This is only a count of raw comparisons.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs.

Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes.

A better approach is to have a one-dimensional array of secondary key values, where each secondary key is associated with a linked list. This works well if the index is stored in main memory, but not so well when it is stored on disk because the linked list for a given key might be scattered across several disk blocks.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs.

Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key.

At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes.

Furthermore, those secondary keys with fewer records than the width of the array will waste the remainder of their row. A better approach is to have a one-dimensional array of secondary key values, where each secondary key is associated with a linked list. This works well if the index is stored in main memory, but not so well when it is stored on disk because the linked list for a given key might be scattered across several disk blocks.', '341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing 3could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Indexing. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index. Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques. Section 10.3 introduces the basic issues related to tree indexing. Section 10.4 in- troduces the 2-3 tree, a balanced tree structure that is a simple form of the B-tree covered in Section 10.5. B-trees are the most widely used indexing method for large disk-based databases, and for implementing ﬁle systems. Since they have such great practical importance, many variations have been invented. Section 10.5 begins with a discussion of the variant normally referred to simply as a “B-tree.” Section 10.5.1 presents the most widely implemented variant, the B+-tree.', 'Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 3341 3342 3Chap. 10 Indexing', 'A linear index is an index ﬁle organized as a sequence of key/pointer pairs where the keys are in sorted order and the pointers either (1) point to the position of the complete record on disk, (2) point to the position of the primary key in the primary index, or (3) are actually the value of the primary key. Depending on its size, a linear index might be stored in main memory or on disk. A linear index provides a number of advantages. It provides convenient access to variable-length database records, because each entry in the index ﬁle contains a ﬁxed-length key ﬁeld and a ﬁxed-length pointer to the beginning of a (variable-length) record as shown in Figure 10.1. A linear index also allows for efﬁcient search and random access to database records, because it is amenable to binary search.', 'A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index.', '10.3 Tree-based Indexing 3Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never.

Its main data structure is an array of linked lists, one linked list for each vertex. These linked lists store objects of type Edge, which merely stores the index for the vertex pointed to by the edge, along with the weight of the edge. 3/** Edge class for Adjacency List graph representation */ class Edge { 3private int vert, wt; 3public Edge(int v, int w) // Constructor 3{ vert = v; wt = w; }', 'We begin in Section 11.1 with some basic graph terminology and then deﬁne two fundamental representations for graphs, the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.2 presents a graph ADT and simple implementations based on the adjacency matrix and adjacency list. Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Both the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list can be used to store directed or undirected graphs. Each edge of an undirected graph connecting Vertices U and V is represented by two directed edges: one from U to V and one from V to U. Figure 11.4 illustrates the use of the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list for undirected graphs.', 'The second common representation for graphs is the adjacency list, illustrated by Figure 11.3(c). The adjacency list is an array of linked lists. The array is |V| items long, with position i storing a pointer to the linked list of edges for Ver- tex vi. This linked list represents the edges by the vertices that are adjacent to Vertex vi. The adjacency list is therefore a generalization of the “list of children” representation for trees described in Section 6.3.1.', 'Which graph representation is more space efﬁcient depends on the number of edges in the graph. The adjacency list stores information only for those edges that actually appear in the graph, while the adjacency matrix requires space for each potential edge, whether it exists or not. However, the adjacency matrix requires no overhead for pointers, which can be a substantial cost, especially if the only 3Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432', 'information stored for an edge is one bit to indicate its existence. As the graph be- comes denser, the adjacency matrix becomes relatively more space efﬁcient. Sparse graphs are likely to have their adjacency list representation be more space efﬁcient.', '377 3378 3Chap. 11 Graphs 3It is reasonably straightforward to implement our graph and edge ADTs using either the adjacency list or adjacency matrix. The sample implementations pre- sented here do not address the issue of how the graph is actually created. The user of these implementations must add functionality for this purpose, perhaps reading the graph description from a ﬁle. The graph can be built up by using the setEdge function provided by the ADT.', 'Sec. 1.2 Abstract Data Types and Data Structures 3ple, Section 12.2 describes the data structure used to implement a sparse matrix, a large two-dimensional array that stores only a relatively few non-zero values. This implementation is quite different from the physical representation of an array as contiguous memory locations.', 'Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432 3Figure 11.4 Using the graph representations for undirected graphs.

(c) If a pointer requires four bytes, a vertex label requires two bytes, and an edge weight requires two bytes, which representation requires more space for this graph?', '11.2 An undirected graph need not explicitly store two separate directed edges to represent a single undirected edge. An alternative would be to store only a single undirected edge (I, J) to connect Vertices I and J. However, what if the user asks for edge (J, I)? We can solve this problem by consistently storing the edge such that the lesser of I and J always comes ﬁrst. Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we notice that only the lower triangle of the array is used. Thus we could cut the space required by the adjacency matrix from |V|2 positions to |V|(|V| − 1)/2 positions. Read Section 12.2 on triangular matrices.

For Dijkstra’s shortest paths algorithm, two different implementations were given in Sec- tion 11.4.1 that provide different ways for determining the next closest vertex at each iteration of the algorithm. The relative costs of these two variants depend on who sparse or dense the graph is. They might also depend on whether the graph is implemented using an adjacency list or adjacency ma- trix. Design and implement a study to compare the effects on performance for three variables: (i) the two graph representations (adjacency list and adja- cency matrix); (ii) the two implementations for Djikstra’s shortest paths alg- orithm (searching the table of vertex distances or using a priority queue to track the distances), and (iii) sparse versus dense graphs. Be sure to test your implementations on a variety of graphs that are sufﬁciently large to generate meaningful times.', '13.3 Spatial Data Structures 3All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces.', 'For a discussion on the relative space requirements for two-way versus multi- way branching, see “A Generalized Comparison of Quadtree and Bintree Storage Requirements” by Shaffer, Juvvadi, and Heath [SJH93]. 3Closely related to spatial data structures are data structures for storing multi- dimensional data (which might not necessarily be spatial in nature).

Its main data structure is an array of linked lists, one linked list for each vertex. These linked lists store objects of type Edge, which merely stores the index for the vertex pointed to by the edge, along with the weight of the edge. 3/** Edge class for Adjacency List graph representation */ class Edge { 3private int vert, wt; 3public Edge(int v, int w) // Constructor 3{ vert = v; wt = w; }', 'We begin in Section 11.1 with some basic graph terminology and then deﬁne two fundamental representations for graphs, the adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

Section 11.3 presents the two most commonly used graph traversal algorithms, called depth-ﬁrst and breadth-ﬁrst search, with application to topological sorting. Section 11.4 presents algorithms for solving some problems related to ﬁnding shortest routes in a graph. Finally, Section 11.5 presents algorithms for ﬁnding the minimum-cost spanning tree, useful for deter- mining lowest-cost connectivity in a network. Besides being useful and interesting in their own right, these algorithms illustrate the use of some data structures pre- sented in earlier chapters.', 'Both the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list can be used to store directed or undirected graphs. Each edge of an undirected graph connecting Vertices U and V is represented by two directed edges: one from U to V and one from V to U. Figure 11.4 illustrates the use of the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list for undirected graphs.', 'The second common representation for graphs is the adjacency list, illustrated by Figure 11.3(c). The adjacency list is an array of linked lists. The array is |V| items long, with position i storing a pointer to the linked list of edges for Ver- tex vi. This linked list represents the edges by the vertices that are adjacent to Vertex vi. The adjacency list is therefore a generalization of the “list of children” representation for trees described in Section 6.3.1.', 'Which graph representation is more space efﬁcient depends on the number of edges in the graph. The adjacency list stores information only for those edges that actually appear in the graph, while the adjacency matrix requires space for each potential edge, whether it exists or not. However, the adjacency matrix requires no overhead for pointers, which can be a substantial cost, especially if the only 3Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432', 'information stored for an edge is one bit to indicate its existence. As the graph be- comes denser, the adjacency matrix becomes relatively more space efﬁcient. Sparse graphs are likely to have their adjacency list representation be more space efﬁcient.', '377 3378 3Chap. 11 Graphs 3It is reasonably straightforward to implement our graph and edge ADTs using either the adjacency list or adjacency matrix. The sample implementations pre- sented here do not address the issue of how the graph is actually created. The user of these implementations must add functionality for this purpose, perhaps reading the graph description from a ﬁle. The graph can be built up by using the setEdge function provided by the ADT.', 'Sec. 1.2 Abstract Data Types and Data Structures 3ple, Section 12.2 describes the data structure used to implement a sparse matrix, a large two-dimensional array that stores only a relatively few non-zero values. This implementation is quite different from the physical representation of an array as contiguous memory locations.', 'Sec. 11.1 Terminology and Representations 3(a)(b)(c)01230123401234111111111111013410104342142432 3Figure 11.4 Using the graph representations for undirected graphs.

An alternative would be to store only a single undirected edge (I, J) to connect Vertices I and J. However, what if the user asks for edge (J, I)? We can solve this problem by consistently storing the edge such that the lesser of I and J always comes ﬁrst. Thus, if we have an edge connecting Vertices 5 and 3, requests for edge (5, 3) and (3, 5) both map to (3, 5) because 3 < 5. Looking at the adjacency matrix, we notice that only the lower triangle of the array is used. Thus we could cut the space required by the adjacency matrix from |V|2 positions to |V|(|V| − 1)/2 positions. Read Section 12.2 on triangular matrices.

For Dijkstra’s shortest paths algorithm, two different implementations were given in Sec- tion 11.4.1 that provide different ways for determining the next closest vertex at each iteration of the algorithm. The relative costs of these two variants depend on who sparse or dense the graph is. They might also depend on whether the graph is implemented using an adjacency list or adjacency ma- trix. Design and implement a study to compare the effects on performance for three variables: (i) the two graph representations (adjacency list and adja- cency matrix); (ii) the two implementations for Djikstra’s shortest paths alg- orithm (searching the table of vertex distances or using a priority queue to track the distances), and (iii) sparse versus dense graphs. Be sure to test your implementations on a variety of graphs that are sufﬁciently large to generate meaningful times.', '13.3 Spatial Data Structures 3All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces.', 'For a discussion on the relative space requirements for two-way versus multi- way branching, see “A Generalized Comparison of Quadtree and Bintree Storage Requirements” by Shaffer, Juvvadi, and Heath [SJH93]. 3Closely related to spatial data structures are data structures for storing multi- dimensional data (which might not necessarily be spatial in nature).

REASON: The score is 0.89 because most relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than irrelevant nodes. For example, the first node discusses 'the adjacency list representation for graphs', which is a key concept, while the eighth node, which is irrelevant, discusses 'sparse matrices, which is not directly related to the key concepts of graphs expected in the output'. However, the score is not higher because some irrelevant nodes, such as the tenth node discussing 'a specific example of space requirements for graph representations', are ranked higher than some relevant nodes, like the eleventh node that discusses 'Dijkstra’s algorithm and the impact of graph representations on its efficiency'.

Design and implement a study to compare the effects on performance for three variables: (i) the two graph representations (adjacency list and adja- cency matrix); (ii) the two implementations for Djikstra’s shortest paths alg- orithm (searching the table of vertex distances or using a priority queue to track the distances), and (iii) sparse versus dense graphs. Be sure to test your implementations on a variety of graphs that are sufﬁciently large to generate meaningful times.', '13.3 Spatial Data Structures 3All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces.', 'For a discussion on the relative space requirements for two-way versus multi- way branching, see “A Generalized Comparison of Quadtree and Bintree Storage Requirements” by Shaffer, Juvvadi, and Heath [SJH93]. 3Closely related to spatial data structures are data structures for storing multi- dimensional data (which might not necessarily be spatial in nature).

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists and Arrays Revisited. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', 'Insert 23:12203813122083382012132313(a)(b)(c)501244321012345503 3Figure 4.3 Inserting an element at the head of an array-based list requires shift- ing all existing elements in the array by one position toward the tail.

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lists and Arrays Revisited. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', 'Insert 23:12203813122083382012132313(a)(b)(c)501244321012345503 3Figure 4.3 Inserting an element at the head of an array-based list requires shift- ing all existing elements in the array by one position toward the tail.

                Context: ['Class AList stores the list elements in the ﬁrst listSize contiguous array positions. Array positions correspond to list positions. In other words, the element at position i in the list is stored at array cell i. The head of the list is always at position 0. This makes random access to any element in the list quite easy. Given some position in the list, the value of the element in that position can be accessed directly. Thus, access to any element using the moveToPos method followed by the getValue method takes Θ(1) time.', 'Array-based lists have the disadvantage that their size must be predetermined before the array can be allocated. Array-based lists cannot grow beyond their pre- determined size. Whenever the list contains only a few elements, a substantial amount of space might be tied up in a largely empty array. Linked lists have the advantage that they only need space for the objects actually on the list. There is no limit to the number of elements on a linked list, as long as there is free-store memory available. The amount of space required by a linked list is Θ(n), while the space required by the array-based list implementation is Ω(n), but can be greater. Array-based lists have the advantage that there is no wasted space for an in- dividual element. Linked lists require that an extra pointer be added to every list node. If the element size is small, then the overhead for links can be a signiﬁcant fraction of the total storage. When the array for the array-based list is completely ﬁlled, there is no storage overhead. The array-based list will then be more space efﬁcient, by a constant factor, than the linked implementation.', 'The array-based stack implementation is essentially a simpliﬁed version of the array-based list. The only important design decision to be made is which end of the array should represent the top of the stack. One choice is to make the top be In terms of list functions, all insert and remove at position 0 in the array. operations would then be on the element in position 0. This implementation is inefﬁcient, because now every push or pop operation will require that all elements currently in the stack be shifted one position in the array, for a cost of Θ(n) if there are n elements. The other choice is have the top element be at position n − 1 when there are n elements in the stack. In other words, as elements are pushed onto the stack, they are appended to the tail of the list. Method pop removes the tail element. In this case, the cost for each push or pop operation is only Θ(1).', '4.1.1 Array-Based List Implementation 3There are two standard approaches to implementing lists, the array-based list, and the linked list. This section discusses the array-based approach. The linked list is presented in Section 4.1.2. Time and space efﬁciency comparisons for the two are discussed in Section 4.1.3. 3Figure 4.2 shows the array-based list implementation, named AList. AList inherits from abstract class List and so must implement all of the member func- tions of List.', '1.20 An unsorted list allows for constant-time insert by adding a new element at the end of the list. Unfortunately, searching for the element with key value X requires a sequential search through the unsorted list until X is found, which on average requires looking at half the list element. On the other hand, a sorted array-based list of n elements can be searched in log n time with a binary search. Unfortunately, inserting a new element requires a lot of time because many elements might be shifted in the array if we want to keep it sorted. How might data be organized to support both insertion and search in log n time?', 'For the list implementations presented in this section, the compiler requires that all objects stored on the list be of the same type. Besides Java generics, there are other techniques that implementors of a list class can use to ensure that the element type for a given list remains ﬁxed, while still permitting different lists to store different element types. One approach is to store an object of the appropriate type in the header node of the list (perhaps an object of the appropriate type is supplied as a parameter to the list constructor), and then check that all insert operations on that list use the same element type.', 'Insert 23:12203813122083382012132313(a)(b)(c)501244321012345503 3Figure 4.3 Inserting an element at the head of an array-based list requires shift- ing all existing elements in the array by one position toward the tail.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['If we are willing to weaken the balance requirements, we can come up with alternative update routines that perform well both in terms of cost for the update and in balance for the resulting tree structure. The AVL tree works in this way, using insertion and deletion routines altered from those of the BST to ensure that, for every node, the depths of the left and right subtrees differ by at most one. The AVL tree is described in Section 13.2.1.', 'This chapter introduces several tree structures designed for use in specialized ap- plications. The trie of Section 13.1 is commonly used to store and retrieve strings. It also serves to illustrate the concept of a key space decomposition. The AVL tree and splay tree of Section 13.2 are variants on the BST. They are examples of self-balancing search trees and have guaranteed good performance regardless of the insertion order for records. An introduction to several spatial data structures used to organize point data by xy-coordinates is presented in Section 13.3.', 'We can solve these problems by selecting another tree structure that automat- ically remains balanced after updates, and which is amenable to storing in blocks. There are a number of balanced tree data structures, and there are also techniques for keeping BSTs balanced. Examples are the AVL and splay trees discussed in Section 13.2. As an alternative, Section 10.4 presents the 2-3 tree, which has the property that its leaves are always at the same level. The main reason for discussing the 2-3 tree here in preference to the other balanced search trees is that it naturally', 'way that retains the BST property. While Figure 13.7 is slightly different from Figure 13.5, in fact the splay tree single rotation is identical to the AVL tree single rotation. 3Unlike the AVL tree, the splay tree requires two types of double rotation. Dou- ble rotations involve S, its parent (call it P), and S’s grandparent (call it G). The effect of a double rotation is to move S up two levels in the tree. 3The ﬁrst double rotation is called a zigzag rotation. It takes place when either', 'Sec. 13.2 Balanced Trees 372324240120374224723242401203742245 3Figure 13.4 Example of an insert operation that violates the AVL tree balance property. Prior to the insert operation, all nodes of the tree are balanced (i.e., the depths of the left and right subtrees for every node differ by at most one).

REASON: The score is 0.97 because the relevant nodes in the retrieval context are mostly ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first seven nodes are relevant, discussing topics like 'AVL trees and their balance properties', 'trie and key space decomposition', and 'splay tree rotations', which align well with the expected output. However, the eighth node, which focuses on 'specific AVL tree operations and splay tree searches', is not directly relevant and should be ranked lower. Similarly, the ninth node discussing 'B-trees' and the tenth node on 'splay tree operations with duplicate keys' are not relevant to the key concepts and should be ranked lower than the relevant nodes.

While Figure 13.7 is slightly different from Figure 13.5, in fact the splay tree single rotation is identical to the AVL tree single rotation. 3Unlike the AVL tree, the splay tree requires two types of double rotation. Dou- ble rotations involve S, its parent (call it P), and S’s grandparent (call it G). The effect of a double rotation is to move S up two levels in the tree. 3The ﬁrst double rotation is called a zigzag rotation. It takes place when either', 'Sec. 13.2 Balanced Trees 372324240120374224723242401203742245 3Figure 13.4 Example of an insert operation that violates the AVL tree balance property. Prior to the insert operation, all nodes of the tree are balanced (i.e., the depths of the left and right subtrees for every node differ by at most one). After inserting the node with value 5, the nodes with values 7 and 24 are no longer balanced. 313.2.1 The AVL Tree', '13.3 Spatial Data Structures 3All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces.', '405 3405 408 412 414 421 425 426 427 3429 3429 3Contents 313.2 Balanced Trees 313.2.1 The AVL Tree 13.2.2 The Splay Tree 13.3 Spatial Data Structures 13.3.1 The K-D Tree 13.3.2 The PR quadtree 13.3.3 Other Point Data Structures 13.3.4 Other Spatial Data Structures 313.4 Further Reading 13.5 Exercises 13.6 Projects 3V Theory of Algorithms 314 Analysis Techniques 314.1 Summation Techniques 14.2 Recurrence Relations', '300 into the AVL tree on the left in Figure 13.4. 3(c) Show the result (including appropriate rotations) of inserting the value 350 into the AVL tree on the left in Figure 13.4. 3(d) Show the result (including appropriate rotations) of inserting the value 31 into the AVL tree on the left in Figure 13.4. 313.6 Show the splay tree that results from searching for value 75 in the splay tree 3of Figure 13.10(d). 313.7 Show the splay tree that results from searching for value 18 in the splay tree', '455 3456 3Chap. 13 Advanced Tree Structures 3Implement the sufﬁx tree for a dictionary of words or phrases, with support for wildcard search. 313.3 Revise the BST class of Section 5.4 to use the AVL tree rotations.

The k-d tree pro- vides an object space decomposition of the region, while the PR quadtree provides a key space decomposition (thus, it is a trie). The k-d tree stores records at all nodes, while the PR quadtree stores records only at the leaf nodes. Finally, the two trees have different structures. The k-d tree is a binary tree (and need not be full), while the PR quadtree is a full tree with 2d branches (in the two-dimensional case, 22 = 4). Consider the extension of this concept to three dimensions. A k-d tree for three dimensions would alternate the discriminator through the x, y, and z dimen- sions.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds 3the concept of an adversarial lower bounds proof. Section 15.5 illustrates the con- cept of a state space lower bound. Section 15.6 presents a linear time worst-case algorithm for ﬁnding the ith biggest element on a list. Section 15.7 continues our discussion of sorting with a quest for the algorithm that requires the absolute fewest number of comparisons needed to sort a list. 315.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', 'Given this deﬁnition for searching, we can easily come up with the standard sequential search algorithm, and we can also see that the lower bound for this prob- lem is “obviously” n comparisons. (Keep in mind that the key K might not actually appear in the list.)

                Given the following context, please identify the 10 most important learning concepts related to the chapter on Lower Bounds. 
                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set. Section 15.4 presents 3485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds', 'Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs 3Now we know precisely what we are aiming for when designing an algorithm: We want to ﬁnd an algorithm who’s upper bound matches the lower bound of the problem. Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds 3the concept of an adversarial lower bounds proof. Section 15.5 illustrates the con- cept of a state space lower bound. Section 15.6 presents a linear time worst-case algorithm for ﬁnding the ith biggest element on a list. Section 15.7 continues our discussion of sorting with a quest for the algorithm that requires the absolute fewest number of comparisons needed to sort a list. 315.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion.

                Context: ['One problem with differentiating the concepts of upper and lower bounds is that, for most algorithms that you will encounter, it is easy to recognize the true growth rate for that algorithm. Given complete knowledge about a cost function, the upper and lower bound for that cost function are always the same. Thus, the distinction between an upper and a lower bound is only worthwhile when you have incomplete knowledge about the thing being measured. If this distinction is still not clear, reread Section 3.6. We use Θ-notation to indicate that there is no meaningful difference between what we know about the growth rates of the upper and lower bound (which is usually the case for simple algorithms).', 'In Section 3.6 we deﬁned the upper bound for a problem to be the upper bound of the best algorithm we know for that problem, and the lower bound to be the tightest lower bound that we can prove over all algorithms for that problem. While we usually can recognize the upper bound for a given algorithm, ﬁnding the tightest lower bound for all possible algorithms is often difﬁcult, especially if that lower bound is more than the “trivial” lower bound determined by measuring the amount of input that must be processed.', 'The lower bound for the problem is the tightest (highest) lower bound that we can prove for all possible algorithms that solve the problem.1 This can be a difﬁcult bar, given that we cannot possibly know all algorithms for any problem, because there are theoretically an inﬁnite number. However, we can often recognize a simple lower bound based on the amount of input that must be examined. For example, we can argue that the lower bound for any algorithm to ﬁnd the maximum-valued element in an unsorted list must be Ω(n) because any algorithm must examine all of the inputs to be sure that it actually ﬁnds the maximum value.', '537 3538 3Chap. 17 Limits to Computation 3There is another use of reductions aside from applying an old algorithm to solve a new problem (and thereby establishing an upper bound for the new problem). That is to prove a lower bound on the cost of a new problem by showing that it could be used as a solution for an old problem with a known lower bound.', 'Often the most effective way to determine the lower bound for a problem is to ﬁnd a reduction to another problem whose lower bound is already known. This is the subject of Chapter 17. However, this approach does not help us when we cannot ﬁnd a suitable “similar problem.” Our focus in this chapter is discovering and proving lower bounds from ﬁrst principles. Our most signiﬁcant example of a lower bounds argument so far is the proof from Section 7.9 that the problem of sorting is O(n log n) in the worst case.', 'Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 33.7 Common Misunderstandings', 'Section 15.1 reviews the concept of a lower bound for a problem and presents the basic “algorithm” for ﬁnding a good algorithm. Section 15.2 discusses lower bounds on searching in lists, both those that are unordered and those that are or- dered. Section 15.3 deals with ﬁnding the maximum value in a list, and presents a model for selection based on building a partially ordered set.

Putting together all that we know so far about algorithms, we can organize our thinking into the following “algorithm for designing algorithms.”2 3If the upper and lower bounds match, then stop, else if the bounds are close or the problem isn’t important,', 'Merge insert sort is pretty good, but is it optimal? Recall from Section 7.9 that no sorting algorithm can be faster than Ω(n log n). To be precise, the information theoretic lower bound for sorting can be proved to be (cid:100)log n!(cid:101). That is, we can prove a lower bound of exactly (cid:100)log n!(cid:101) comparisons. Merge insert sort gives us a number of comparisons equal to this information theoretic lower bound for all values up to n = 12. At n = 12, merge insert sort requires 30 comparisons while the information theoretic lower bound is only 29 comparisons. However, for such a small number of elements, it is possible to do an exhaustive study of every possible arrangement of comparisons. It turns out that there is in fact no possible arrangement of comparisons that makes the lower bound less than 30 comparisons when n = 12. Thus, the information theoretic lower bound is an underestimate in this case, because 30 really is the best that can be done.', 'So now we have an answer to the question “How do I know if I have a good algorithm to solve a problem?” An algorithm is good (asymptotically speaking) if its upper bound matches the problem’s lower bound. If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds 3the concept of an adversarial lower bounds proof. Section 15.5 illustrates the con- cept of a state space lower bound. Section 15.6 presents a linear time worst-case algorithm for ﬁnding the ith biggest element on a list.

REASON: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes in the retrieval context are ranked higher than the irrelevant nodes. The first twelve nodes are relevant as they discuss key concepts such as 'the distinction between upper and lower bounds', 'defining upper and lower bounds', and 'using reductions to prove lower bounds', which are directly related to the input. The irrelevant nodes, starting from the thirteenth node, discuss topics like 'general algorithm analysis', 'sequential search', and 'binary trees', which are not directly related to lower bounds.

If they match, we know to stop trying to ﬁnd an (asymptotically) faster algorithm. What if the (known) upper bound for our algorithm does not match the (known) lower bound for the problem? In this case, we might not know what to do. Is our upper bound ﬂawed, and the algorithm is really faster than we can prove? Is our lower bound weak, and the true lower bound for the problem is greater? Or is our algorithm simply not the best?', '15.2 Lower Bounds on Searching Lists 3In Section 7.9 we presented an important lower bounds proof to show that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case. In Chapter 9 we discussed a number of algorithms to search in sorted and unsorted lists, but we did not provide any lower bounds proofs to this important problem. We will extend our pool of techniques for lower bounds proofs in this section by studying lower bounds for searching unsorted and sorted lists.', '485 3486 3Chap. 15 Lower Bounds 3the concept of an adversarial lower bounds proof. Section 15.5 illustrates the con- cept of a state space lower bound. Section 15.6 presents a linear time worst-case algorithm for ﬁnding the ith biggest element on a list. Section 15.7 continues our discussion of sorting with a quest for the algorithm that requires the absolute fewest number of comparisons needed to sort a list. 315.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', '4. If f1(n) is in O(g1(n)) and f2(n) is in O(g2(n)), then f1(n)f2(n) is in O(g1(n)g2(n)). 3The ﬁrst rule says that if some function g(n) is an upper bound for your cost function, then any upper bound for g(n) is also an upper bound for your cost func- tion. A similar property holds true for Ω notation: If g(n) is a lower bound for your 367 368 3Chap. 3 Algorithm Analysis 3cost function, then any lower bound for g(n) is also a lower bound for your cost function. Likewise for Θ notation.', 'Given this deﬁnition for searching, we can easily come up with the standard sequential search algorithm, and we can also see that the lower bound for this prob- lem is “obviously” n comparisons. (Keep in mind that the key K might not actually appear in the list.) However, lower bounds proofs are a bit slippery, and it is in- structive to see how they can go wrong. 3Theorem 15.1 The lower bound for the problem of searching in an unsorted list is n comparisons.', '1Throughout this discussion, it should be understood that any mention of bounds must specify what class of inputs are being considered. Do we mean the bound for the worst case input? The average cost over all inputs? Regardless of which class of inputs we consider, all of the issues raised apply equally. 3Sec. 15.1 Introduction to Lower Bounds Proofs', 'Flyweight 3Strategy 31.4 Problems, Algorithms, and Programs 1.5 Further Reading 1.6 Exercises 32 Mathematical Preliminaries 2.1 Sets and Relations 2.2 Miscellaneous Notation 2.3 Logarithms 2.4 Summations and Recurrences 2.5 Recursion 2.6 Mathematical Proof Techniques 3xiii 31 33 4 4 6 8 12 13 13 14 15 16 18 20 323 23 27 29 30 34 36 3iii 3iv 32.6.1 Direct Proof 2.6.2 2.6.3 2.7 Estimation 2.8 Further Reading 2.9 Exercises 3Proof by Contradiction Proof by Mathematical Induction', '6.6 Further Reading 36.7 Exercises 36.8 Projects 3III Sorting and Searching 37 Internal Sorting 37.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms Insertion Sort 37.2.1 37.2.2 Bubble Sort 37.2.3 3Selection Sort 37.2.4 The Cost of Exchange Sorting 37.3 Shellsort 37.4 Mergesort 37.5 Quicksort 37.6 Heapsort 37.7 Binsort and Radix Sort 37.8 An Empirical Comparison of Sorting Algorithms 37.9 Lower Bounds for Sorting 37.10 Further Reading 37.11 Exercises 37.12 Projects 3Contents', '[Man89] 3Introduction to Algorithms: A Creative Approach. 3[MM04] 3[MM08] 3[P´ol57] 3[Pug90] W.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['There are many approaches to solving recurrence relations, and we brieﬂy con- sider three here. The ﬁrst is an estimation technique: Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove the bounds, and tighten as re- quired. The second approach is to expand the recurrence to convert it to a summa- tion and then use summation techniques. The third approach is to take advantage of already proven theorems when the recurrence is of a suitable form. In particu- lar, typical divide and conquer algorithms such as Mergesort yield recurrences of a form that ﬁts a pattern for which we have a ready solution.', 'We can categorize search algorithms into three general approaches: 31. Sequential and list methods. 2. Direct access by key value (hashing). 3. Tree indexing methods. 3This and the following chapter treat these three approaches in turn. Any of these approaches are potentially suitable for implementing the Dictionary ADT 3301 3302 3Chap. 9 Searching 3introduced in Section 4.4. However, each has different performance characteristics that make it the method of choice in particular circumstances.', 'A more general approach is based on the subtract-and-guess or divide-and- guess strategies. One form of subtract-and-guess is known as the shifting method. The shifting method subtracts the summation from a variation on the summation. The variation selected for the subtraction should be one that makes most of the terms cancel out. To solve sum f , we pick a known function g and ﬁnd a pattern in terms of f (n) − g(n) or f (n)/g(n).', 'One of the biggest challenges to understanding design patterns is that some- times one is only subtly different from another. For example, you might be con- fused about the difference between the composite pattern and the visitor pattern. The distinction is that the composite design pattern is about whether to give control of the traversal process to the nodes of the tree or to the tree itself. Both approaches can make use of the visitor design pattern to avoid rewriting the traversal function many times, by encapsulating the activity performed at each node.', '16 Patterns of Algorithms 316.1 Dynamic Programming 316.1.1 The Knapsack Problem 16.1.2 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 316.2 Randomized Algorithms 316.2.1 Randomized algorithms for ﬁnding large values 16.2.2 Skip Lists 16.3 Numerical Algorithms 16.3.1 Exponentiation 16.3.2 Largest Common Factor 16.3.3 Matrix Multiplication 16.3.4 Random Numbers 16.3.5 The Fast Fourier Transform 316.4 Further Reading 16.5 Exercises 16.6 Projects 317 Limits to Computation 317.1 Reductions 17.2 Hard Problems', '8.3 Buffers and Buffer Pools 8.4 The Programmer’s View of Files 8.5 External Sorting 38.5.1 8.5.2 Replacement Selection 8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3Simple Approaches to External Sorting 38.6 Further Reading 8.7 Exercises 8.8 Projects 39 Searching 39.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 9.2 Self-Organizing Lists 9.3 Bit Vectors for Representing Sets 9.4 Hashing', 'T(n) = T(n − 1) + 1 3= (T(n − 2) + 1) + 1. 3Sec. 2.4 Summations and Recurrences 3We can expand the recurrence as many steps as we like, but the goal is to detect some pattern that will permit us to rewrite the recurrence in terms of a summation. In this example, we might notice that 3(T(n − 2) + 1) + 1 = T(n − 2) + 2 3and if we expand the recurrence again, we get 3T(n) = T(n − 2) + 2 = T(n − 3) + 1 + 2 = T(n − 3) + 3 3which generalizes to the pattern T(n) = T(n − i) + i. We might conclude that', 'We could write a separate traversal function for each such activity that we in- tend to perform on the tree. A better approach would be to write a generic traversal function, and pass in the activity to be performed at each node. This organization constitutes the visitor design pattern.

Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'which generalizes to the pattern T(n) = T(n − i) + i.

                Your response should directly reference key concepts and terminology from the context provided.

                Context: ['There are many approaches to solving recurrence relations, and we brieﬂy con- sider three here. The ﬁrst is an estimation technique: Guess the upper and lower bounds for the recurrence, use induction to prove the bounds, and tighten as re- quired. The second approach is to expand the recurrence to convert it to a summa- tion and then use summation techniques. The third approach is to take advantage of already proven theorems when the recurrence is of a suitable form. In particu- lar, typical divide and conquer algorithms such as Mergesort yield recurrences of a form that ﬁts a pattern for which we have a ready solution.', 'We can categorize search algorithms into three general approaches: 31. Sequential and list methods. 2. Direct access by key value (hashing). 3. Tree indexing methods. 3This and the following chapter treat these three approaches in turn. Any of these approaches are potentially suitable for implementing the Dictionary ADT 3301 3302 3Chap. 9 Searching 3introduced in Section 4.4. However, each has different performance characteristics that make it the method of choice in particular circumstances.', 'A more general approach is based on the subtract-and-guess or divide-and- guess strategies. One form of subtract-and-guess is known as the shifting method. The shifting method subtracts the summation from a variation on the summation. The variation selected for the subtraction should be one that makes most of the terms cancel out. To solve sum f , we pick a known function g and ﬁnd a pattern in terms of f (n) − g(n) or f (n)/g(n).', 'One of the biggest challenges to understanding design patterns is that some- times one is only subtly different from another. For example, you might be con- fused about the difference between the composite pattern and the visitor pattern. The distinction is that the composite design pattern is about whether to give control of the traversal process to the nodes of the tree or to the tree itself. Both approaches can make use of the visitor design pattern to avoid rewriting the traversal function many times, by encapsulating the activity performed at each node.', '16 Patterns of Algorithms 316.1 Dynamic Programming 316.1.1 The Knapsack Problem 16.1.2 All-Pairs Shortest Paths 316.2 Randomized Algorithms 316.2.1 Randomized algorithms for ﬁnding large values 16.2.2 Skip Lists 16.3 Numerical Algorithms 16.3.1 Exponentiation 16.3.2 Largest Common Factor 16.3.3 Matrix Multiplication 16.3.4 Random Numbers 16.3.5 The Fast Fourier Transform 316.4 Further Reading 16.5 Exercises 16.6 Projects 317 Limits to Computation 317.1 Reductions 17.2 Hard Problems', '8.3 Buffers and Buffer Pools 8.4 The Programmer’s View of Files 8.5 External Sorting 38.5.1 8.5.2 Replacement Selection 8.5.3 Multiway Merging 3Simple Approaches to External Sorting 38.6 Further Reading 8.7 Exercises 8.8 Projects 39 Searching 39.1 Searching Unsorted and Sorted Arrays 9.2 Self-Organizing Lists 9.3 Bit Vectors for Representing Sets 9.4 Hashing', 'T(n) = T(n − 1) + 1 3= (T(n − 2) + 1) + 1. 3Sec. 2.4 Summations and Recurrences 3We can expand the recurrence as many steps as we like, but the goal is to detect some pattern that will permit us to rewrite the recurrence in terms of a summation. In this example, we might notice that 3(T(n − 2) + 1) + 1 = T(n − 2) + 2 3and if we expand the recurrence again, we get 3T(n) = T(n − 2) + 2 = T(n − 3) + 1 + 2 = T(n − 3) + 3 3which generalizes to the pattern T(n) = T(n − i) + i. We might conclude that', 'We could write a separate traversal function for each such activity that we in- tend to perform on the tree. A better approach would be to write a generic traversal function, and pass in the activity to be performed at each node. This organization constitutes the visitor design pattern. The visitor design pattern is used in Sec- tions 5.2 (tree traversal) and 11.3 (graph traversal). 31.3.3 Composite', 'Figure 7.20 shows timing results for actual implementations of the sorting algo- rithms presented in this chapter. The algorithms compared include Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Shellsort, Quicksort, Mergesort, Heapsort and Radix Sort. Shellsort shows both the basic version from Section 7.3 and another with increments based on division by three. Mergesort shows both the basic implemen- tation from Section 7.4 and the optimized version (including calls to Insertion Sort for lists of length below nine). For Quicksort, two versions are compared: the basic implementation from Section 7.5 and an optimized version that does not partition sublists below length nine (with Insertion Sort performed at the end). The ﬁrst Heapsort version uses the class deﬁnitions from Section 5.5. The second version removes all the class deﬁnitions and operates directly on the array using inlined code for all access functions.', 'which generalizes to the pattern T(n) = T(n − i) + i. We might conclude that 3T(n) = T(n − (n − 1)) + (n − 1) 3= T(1) + n − 1 3= n − 1. 3Because we have merely guessed at a pattern and not actually proved that this is the correct closed form solution, we should use an induction proof to complete the process (see Example 2.13). 3Example 2.9 A slightly more complicated recurrence is 3T(n) = T(n − 1) + n; T (1) = 1. 3Expanding this recurrence a few steps, we get 3T(n) = T(n − 1) + n', 'Once the traversal algorithm completes, we can check to see if all vertices have been processed by checking the mark bit array.
