The second row shows the four sublists of size 2 created by the ﬁrst merging pass. The third row shows the two sublists of size 4 created by the next merging pass on the sublists of row 2. The last row shows the ﬁnal sorted list created by merging the two sublists of row 3. Mergesort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms conceptually, and has good performance both in the asymptotic sense and in empirical running time. Surpris- ingly, even though it is based on a simple concept, it is relatively difﬁcult to im- plement in practice. Figure 7.8 illustrates Mergesort. A pseudocode sketch of Mergesort is as follows: List mergesort(List inlist) { if (inlist.length() <= 1) return inlist;; List L1 = half of the items from inlist; List L2 = other half of the items from inlist; return merge(mergesort(L1), mergesort(L2)); } Before discussing how to implement Mergesort, we will ﬁrst examine the merge function. Merging two sorted sublists is quite simple. Function merge examines the ﬁrst element of each sublist and picks the smaller value as the smallest element overall. This smaller value is removed from its sublist and placed into the output list. Merging continues in this way, comparing the front elements of the sublists and continually appending the smaller to the output list until no more input elements remain. Implementing Mergesort presents a number of technical difﬁculties. The ﬁrst decision is how to represent the lists. Mergesort lends itself well to sorting a singly linked list because merging does not require random access to the list elements. Thus, Mergesort is the method of choice when the input is in the form of a linked list. Implementing merge for linked lists is straightforward, because we need only remove items from the front of the input lists and append items to the output list. Breaking the input list into two equal halves presents some difﬁculty.These assumptions can be  284 Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting relaxed for special-purpose sorting applications, but ignoring such complications makes the principles clearer. As explained in Section 8.2, a sector is the basic unit of I/O. In other words, all disk reads and writes are for one or more complete sectors. Sector sizes are typically a power of two, in the range 512 to 16K bytes, depending on the operating system and the size and speed of the disk drive. The block size used for external sorting algorithms should be equal to or a multiple of the sector size. Under this model, a sorting algorithm reads a block of data into a buffer in main memory, performs some processing on it, and at some future time writes it back to disk. From Section 8.1 we see that reading or writing a block from disk takes on the order of one million times longer than a memory access. Based on this fact, we can reasonably expect that the records contained in a single block can be sorted by an internal sorting algorithm such as Quicksort in less time than is required to read or write the block. Under good conditions, reading from a ﬁle in sequential order is more efﬁcient than reading blocks in random order. Given the signiﬁcant impact of seek time on disk access, it might seem obvious that sequential processing is faster. However, it is important to understand precisely under what circumstances sequential ﬁle processing is actually faster than random access, because it affects our approach to designing an external sorting algorithm. Efﬁcient sequential access relies on seek time being kept to a minimum. The ﬁrst requirement is that the blocks making up a ﬁle are in fact stored on disk in sequential order and close together, preferably ﬁlling a small number of contiguous tracks. At the very least, the number of extents making up the ﬁle should be small. Users typically do not have much control over the layout of their ﬁle on disk, but writing a ﬁle all at once in sequential order to a disk drive with a high percentage of free space increases the likelihood of such an arrangement. The second requirement is that the disk drive’s I/O head remain positioned over the ﬁle throughout sequential processing. This will not happen if there is competition of any kind for the I/O head. For example, on a multi-user time-shared computer the sorting process might compete for the I/O head with the processes of other users. Even when the sorting process has sole control of the I/O head, it is still likely that sequential processing will not be efﬁcient. Imagine the situation where all processing is done on a single disk drive, with the typical arrangement of a single bank of read/write heads that move together over a stack of platters. If the sorting process involves reading from an input ﬁle, alternated with writing to an output ﬁle, then the I/O head will continuously seek between the input ﬁle and the output ﬁle. Similarly, if two input ﬁles are being processed simultaneously (such as during a merge process), then the I/O head will continuously seek between these two ﬁles. Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 285 The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice. As mentioned previously, the record size might be quite large compared to the size of the key.Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques..\n",
      "  - actual output: Here are the five most important learning concepts for the chapter on File Processing and External Sorting, particularly in the context of tree indexing methods and the implementation of sorting algorithms: 1. **Mergesort Algorithm**: Understanding the Mergesort algorithm is crucial as it is a fundamental external sorting technique. The recursive nature of Mergesort, where the list is divided into smaller sublists and then merged back together, highlights the importance of efficient merging processes. The pseudocode provided illustrates how Mergesort operates, emphasizing its conceptual simplicity and practical challenges. 2. **External Sorting vs. Internal Sorting**: The distinction between external and internal sorting is vital. External sorting is necessary when dealing with data that cannot fit into main memory, requiring the use of disk storage. The chapter discusses how external sorting algorithms, like Mergesort, are designed to minimize disk I/O operations, which are significantly slower than memory accesses. 3. **Disk I/O and Buffer Management**: Understanding the impact of disk I/O on performance is essential. The chapter explains that reading and writing data in blocks (or sectors) is more efficient than random access. Efficient buffer management and the organization of data on disk can greatly affect the performance of sorting algorithms, making it important to consider how data is laid out on disk. 4. **Sequential vs. Random Access**: The chapter emphasizes the conditions under which sequential file processing is more efficient than random access. It discusses the importance of minimizing seek time and ensuring that data blocks are stored contiguously on disk. This understanding is critical for designing efficient external sorting algorithms that leverage sequential access patterns. 5. **Tree Indexing Methods**: The chapter introduces tree indexing methods as a means to organize large databases that require efficient record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Understanding the role of tree structures in indexing and their relationship to sorting and searching operations is important for implementing the Dictionary ADT and optimizing data retrieval processes. These concepts collectively provide a foundational understanding of file processing and external sorting, highlighting the interplay between algorithm design, data organization, and system performance.\n",

      "  - input: Identify the 5 most important learning concepts for chapter Indexing. The relevant context can be found here: Under extreme conditions, many searches might eventually lead to the system overﬂow area. The “solution” to this problem is to periodically reorganize the entire database. This means re-balancing the records 1Recall from Section 8.2.1 that a cylinder is all of the tracks readable from a particular placement of the heads on the multiple platters of a disk drive. 348 Chap. 10 Indexing among the cylinders, sorting the records within each cylinder, and updating both the system index table and the within-cylinder block table. Such reorganization was typical of database systems during the 1960s and would normally be done each night or weekly. 10.3 Tree-based Indexing Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. In their most general form, database applications have the following character- istics: 1.10 Chap. 1 Data Structures and Algorithms One application that makes use of some ADT might use particular member functions of that ADT more than a second application, or the two applications might have different time requirements for the various operations. These differences in the requirements of applications are the reason why a given ADT might be supported by more than one implementation. Example 1.5 Two popular implementations for large disk-based database applications are hashing (Section 9.4) and the B+-tree (Section 10.5). Both support efﬁcient insertion and deletion of records, and both support exact- match queries. However, hashing is more efﬁcient than the B+-tree for exact-match queries. On the other hand, the B+-tree can perform range queries efﬁciently, while hashing is hopelessly inefﬁcient for range queries. Thus, if the database application limits searches to exact-match queries, hashing is preferred. On the other hand, if the application requires support for range queries, the B+-tree is preferred. Despite these performance is- sues, both implementations solve versions of the same problem: updating and searching a large collection of records. The concept of an ADT can help us to focus on key issues even in non-comp- uting applications. Example 1.6 When operating a car, the primary activities are steering, accelerating, and braking. On nearly all passenger cars, you steer by turn- ing the steering wheel, accelerate by pushing the gas pedal, and brake by pushing the brake pedal. This design for cars can be viewed as an ADT with operations “steer,” “accelerate,” and “brake.” Two cars might imple- ment these operations in radically different ways, say with different types of engine, or front- versus rear-wheel drive. Yet, most drivers can oper- ate many different cars because the ADT presents a uniform method of operation that does not require the driver to understand the speciﬁcs of any particular engine or drive design. These differences are deliberately hidden.Notice that the splaying process has made the tree shallower. 13.3 Spatial Data Structures All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces. Some databases require support for multiple keys. In other words, records can be searched for using any one of several key ﬁelds, such as name or ID number. Typically, each such key has its own one-dimensional index, and any given search query searches one of these independent indices as appropriate. A multidimensional search key presents a rather different concept. Imagine that we have a database of city records, where each city has a name and an xy- coordinate. A BST or splay tree provides good performance for searches on city name, which is a one-dimensional key. Separate BSTs could be used to index the x- and y-coordinates. This would allow us to insert and delete cities, and locate them by name or by one coordinate. However, search on one of the two coordinates is not a natural way to view search in a two-dimensional space. Another option is to combine the xy-coordinates into a single key, say by concatenating the two coor- dinates, and index cities by the resulting key in a BST. That would allow search by coordinate, but would not allow for efﬁcient two-dimensional range queries such as searching for all cities within a given distance of a speciﬁed point. The problem is that the BST only works well for one-dimensional keys, while a coordinate is a two-dimensional key where neither dimension is more important than the other. Multidimensional range queries are the deﬁning feature of a spatial applica- tion.The classic example is a large database of records with multiple search keys, requiring the ability to insert, delete, and search for records. Hashing provides outstanding performance for such situations, but only in the limited case in which all searches are of the form “ﬁnd the record with key value K.” Many applications require more general search capabilities. One exam- ple is a range query search for all records whose key lies within some range. Other queries might involve visiting all records in order of their key value, or ﬁnding the record with the greatest key value. Hash tables are not organized to support any of these queries efﬁciently. This chapter introduces ﬁle structures used to organize a large collection of records stored on disk. Such ﬁle structures support efﬁcient insertion, deletion, and search operations, for exact-match queries, range queries, and largest/smallest key value searches. Before discussing such ﬁle structures, we must become familiar with some ba- sic ﬁle-processing terminology. An entry-sequenced ﬁle stores records in the order that they were added to the ﬁle. Entry-sequenced ﬁles are the disk-based equivalent to an unsorted list and so do not support efﬁcient search. The natural solution is to sort the records by order of the search key. However, a typical database, such as a collection of employee or customer records maintained by a business, might con- tain multiple search keys. To answer a question about a particular customer might require a search on the name of the customer. Businesses often wish to sort and output the records by zip code order for a bulk mailing. Government paperwork might require the ability to search by Social Security number. Thus, there might not be a single “correct” order in which to store the records. Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 341  342 Chap. 10 Indexing could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld. Each record of a database normally has a unique identiﬁer, called the primary key. For example, the primary key for a set of personnel records might be the Social Security number or ID number for the individual. Unfortunately, the ID number is generally an inconvenient value on which to perform a search because the searcher is unlikely to know it. Instead, the searcher might know the desired employee’s name. Alternatively, the searcher might be interested in ﬁnding all employees whose salary is in a certain range. If these are typical search requests to the database, then the name and salary ﬁelds deserve separate indices. However, key values in the name and salary indices are not likely to be unique. A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index. Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index..\n",
      "  - actual output: Here are the five most important learning concepts for the chapter on Indexing: 1. **Reorganization of Databases**: Understanding the necessity of periodically reorganizing databases to prevent overflow and maintain efficiency. This involves re-balancing records among cylinders, sorting records within each cylinder, and updating the system index table and within-cylinder block table. 2. **Tree-based Indexing Structures**: Familiarity with various tree-based indexing structures, such as B+-trees, and their advantages for dynamic databases. Recognizing that while linear indexing is efficient for static databases, tree structures are better suited for databases with frequent updates, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching. 3. **Key Types and Indexing**: Differentiating between primary keys (unique identifiers for records) and secondary keys (non-unique fields used for searching). Understanding how secondary indices relate to primary keys and the importance of having multiple indices to support various search queries. 4. **Hashing vs. Tree Indexing**: Comparing the performance of hashing and tree-based indexing methods. Hashing is efficient for exact-match queries, while tree structures like B+-trees excel in range queries. This concept emphasizes the importance of choosing the right indexing method based on the specific query requirements of the application. 5. **Multidimensional Indexing**: Recognizing the challenges of indexing in multidimensional spaces, such as when dealing with records that have multiple search keys (e.g., coordinates). Understanding that traditional one-dimensional indexing methods may not be suitable for multidimensional queries and the need for specialized data structures to handle such cases effectively. These concepts provide a foundational understanding of indexing in databases, highlighting the importance of efficient data organization and retrieval methods.\n",

      "  - retrieval context: ['Under extreme conditions, many searches might eventually lead to the system overﬂow area. The “solution” to this problem is to periodically reorganize the entire database. This means re-balancing the records 1Recall from Section 8.2.1 that a cylinder is all of the tracks readable from a particular placement of the heads on the multiple platters of a disk drive. 348 Chap. 10 Indexing among the cylinders, sorting the records within each cylinder, and updating both the system index table and the within-cylinder block table. Such reorganization was typical of database systems during the 1960s and would normally be done each night or weekly. 10.3 Tree-based Indexing Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. In their most general form, database applications have the following character- istics: 1.10 Chap. 1 Data Structures and Algorithms One application that makes use of some ADT might use particular member functions of that ADT more than a second application, or the two applications might have different time requirements for the various operations. These differences in the requirements of applications are the reason why a given ADT might be supported by more than one implementation. Example 1.5 Two popular implementations for large disk-based database applications are hashing (Section 9.4) and the B+-tree (Section 10.5). Both support efﬁcient insertion and deletion of records, and both support exact- match queries. However, hashing is more efﬁcient than the B+-tree for exact-match queries. On the other hand, the B+-tree can perform range queries efﬁciently, while hashing is hopelessly inefﬁcient for range queries. Thus, if the database application limits searches to exact-match queries, hashing is preferred. On the other hand, if the application requires support for range queries, the B+-tree is preferred. Despite these performance is- sues, both implementations solve versions of the same problem: updating and searching a large collection of records. The concept of an ADT can help us to focus on key issues even in non-comp- uting applications. Example 1.6 When operating a car, the primary activities are steering, accelerating, and braking. On nearly all passenger cars, you steer by turn- ing the steering wheel, accelerate by pushing the gas pedal, and brake by pushing the brake pedal. This design for cars can be viewed as an ADT with operations “steer,” “accelerate,” and “brake.” Two cars might imple- ment these operations in radically different ways, say with different types of engine, or front- versus rear-wheel drive. Yet, most drivers can oper- ate many different cars because the ADT presents a uniform method of operation that does not require the driver to understand the speciﬁcs of any particular engine or drive design. These differences are deliberately hidden.Notice that the splaying process has made the tree shallower. 13.3 Spatial Data Structures All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces. Some databases require support for multiple keys. In other words, records can be searched for using any one of several key ﬁelds, such as name or ID number. Typically, each such key has its own one-dimensional index, and any given search query searches one of these independent indices as appropriate. A multidimensional search key presents a rather different concept. Imagine that we have a database of city records, where each city has a name and an xy- coordinate. A BST or splay tree provides good performance for searches on city name, which is a one-dimensional key. Separate BSTs could be used to index the x- and y-coordinates. This would allow us to insert and delete cities, and locate them by name or by one coordinate. However, search on one of the two coordinates is not a natural way to view search in a two-dimensional space. Another option is to combine the xy-coordinates into a single key, say by concatenating the two coor- dinates, and index cities by the resulting key in a BST. That would allow search by coordinate, but would not allow for efﬁcient two-dimensional range queries such as searching for all cities within a given distance of a speciﬁed point. The problem is that the BST only works well for one-dimensional keys, while a coordinate is a two-dimensional key where neither dimension is more important than the other. Multidimensional range queries are the deﬁning feature of a spatial applica- tion.The classic example is a large database of records with multiple search keys, requiring the ability to insert, delete, and search for records. Hashing provides outstanding performance for such situations, but only in the limited case in which all searches are of the form “ﬁnd the record with key value K.” Many applications require more general search capabilities. One exam- ple is a range query search for all records whose key lies within some range. Other queries might involve visiting all records in order of their key value, or ﬁnding the record with the greatest key value. Hash tables are not organized to support any of these queries efﬁciently. This chapter introduces ﬁle structures used to organize a large collection of records stored on disk. Such ﬁle structures support efﬁcient insertion, deletion, and search operations, for exact-match queries, range queries, and largest/smallest key value searches. Before discussing such ﬁle structures, we must become familiar with some ba- sic ﬁle-processing terminology. An entry-sequenced ﬁle stores records in the order that they were added to the ﬁle. Entry-sequenced ﬁles are the disk-based equivalent to an unsorted list and so do not support efﬁcient search. The natural solution is to sort the records by order of the search key. However, a typical database, such as a collection of employee or customer records maintained by a business, might con- tain multiple search keys. To answer a question about a particular customer might require a search on the name of the customer. Businesses often wish to sort and output the records by zip code order for a bulk mailing. Government paperwork might require the ability to search by Social Security number. Thus, there might not be a single “correct” order in which to store the records. Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 341  342 Chap. 10 Indexing could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld. Each record of a database normally has a unique identiﬁer, called the primary key. For example, the primary key for a set of personnel records might be the Social Security number or ID number for the individual. Unfortunately, the ID number is generally an inconvenient value on which to perform a search because the searcher is unlikely to know it. Instead, the searcher might know the desired employee’s name. Alternatively, the searcher might be interested in ﬁnding all employees whose salary is in a certain range. If these are typical search requests to the database, then the name and salary ﬁelds deserve separate indices. However, key values in the name and salary indices are not likely to be unique. A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index. Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations. A third approach to indexing is the tree index.']\n",

This three-step approach to selecting a data structure operationalizes a data- centered view of the design process. The ﬁrst concern is for the data and the op- erations to be performed on them, the next concern is the representation for those data, and the ﬁnal concern is the implementation of that representation. Resource constraints on certain key operations, such as search, inserting data records, and deleting data records, normally drive the data structure selection pro- cess. Many issues relating to the relative importance of these operations are ad- dressed by the following three questions, which you should ask yourself whenever you must choose a data structure:  6 Chap. 1 Data Structures and Algorithms • Are all data items inserted into the data structure at the beginning, or are insertions interspersed with other operations? Static applications (where the data are loaded at the beginning and never change) typically require only simpler data structures to get an efﬁcient implementation than do dynamic applications. • Can data items be deleted?Only when you have to organize and search through a large number of things do more sophisticated data structures usually become necessary. (We will study how to organize and search through medium amounts of data in Chapters 5, 7, and 9, and discuss how to deal with large amounts of data in Chapters 8–10.) Many applications don’t require any form of search, and they do not require that any or- dering be placed on the objects being stored. Some applications require processing in a strict chronological order, processing objects in the order that they arrived, or perhaps processing objects in the reverse of the order that they arrived. For all these situations, a simple list structure is appropriate. This chapter describes representations for lists in general, as well as two impor- tant list-like structures called the stack and the queue. Along with presenting these fundamental data structures, the other goals of the chapter are to: (1) Give examples of separating a logical representation in the form of an ADT from a physical im- plementation for a data structure. (2) Illustrate the use of asymptotic analysis in the context of some simple operations that you might already be familiar with. In this way you can begin to see how asymptotic analysis works, without the complica- tions that arise when analyzing more sophisticated algorithms and data structures.

      "  - actual output: Based on the provided context regarding the chapter on Searching, here are the five most important learning concepts: 1. **Data Structure Selection Process**: Understanding the three-step approach to selecting a data structure is crucial. This involves considering the data and operations to be performed, the representation of the data, and the implementation of that representation. The selection process is often driven by resource constraints on key operations such as searching, inserting, and deleting data records. 2. **Static vs. Dynamic Applications**: Recognizing the difference between static applications (where data is loaded once and remains unchanged) and dynamic applications (where data can be inserted and deleted) is essential. Static applications can often utilize simpler data structures, while dynamic applications may require more sophisticated structures to efficiently manage data operations. 3. **Indexing and Search Operations**: The concept of indexing is vital for organizing large databases. Indexing allows for efficient access to records based on various keys, including primary and secondary keys. Understanding how to create and utilize index files, which associate keys with record locations, is fundamental for optimizing search operations. 4. **Types of Search Queries**: Familiarity with different types of search queries, such as exact-match queries, range queries, and queries for the largest or smallest key values, is important. Different data structures and indexing methods are suited for different types of queries, and knowing which to use can significantly impact performance. 5. **Asymptotic Analysis**: The use of asymptotic analysis to evaluate the efficiency of data structure operations is a key concept. Understanding how to analyze the time complexity of operations such as searching, inserting, and deleting helps in selecting the most appropriate data structure for a given application, especially when dealing with large datasets. These concepts provide a foundational understanding of searching and data structures, which are critical for effective data management and retrieval in computer science.\n",

      "  - input: Identify the 5 most important learning concepts for chapter Internal Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: We must be careful about how we interpret this last statement, however. The world is certainly better off for the invention of Quicksort, even though Mergesort was available at the time. Quicksort is not asymptotically faster than Mergesort, yet is not merely a “tuning” of Mergesort either. Quicksort is a substantially different approach to sorting. So even when our upper and lower bounds for a problem meet, there are still beneﬁts to be gained from a new, clever algorithm.Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met. Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings Asymptotic analysis is one of the most intellectually difﬁcult topics that undergrad- uate computer science majors are confronted with. Most people ﬁnd growth rates and asymptotic analysis confusing and so develop misconceptions about either the concepts or the terminology.234 Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 36 20 17 13 28 14 23 15 28 23 15 14 36 20 17 13 20 36 13 17 14 28 15 23 13 14 15 17 20 23 28 36 Figure 7.8 An illustration of Mergesort. The ﬁrst row shows eight numbers that are to be sorted. Mergesort will recursively subdivide the list into sublists of one element each, then recombine the sublists. The second row shows the four sublists of size 2 created by the ﬁrst merging pass. The third row shows the two sublists of size 4 created by the next merging pass on the sublists of row 2. The last row shows the ﬁnal sorted list created by merging the two sublists of row 3. Mergesort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms conceptually, and has good performance both in the asymptotic sense and in empirical running time. Surpris- ingly, even though it is based on a simple concept, it is relatively difﬁcult to im- plement in practice. Figure 7.8 illustrates Mergesort. A pseudocode sketch of Mergesort is as follows: List mergesort(List inlist) { if (inlist.length() <= 1) return inlist;; List L1 = half of the items from inlist; List L2 = other half of the items from inlist; return merge(mergesort(L1), mergesort(L2)); } Before discussing how to implement Mergesort, we will ﬁrst examine the merge function. Merging two sorted sublists is quite simple. Function merge examines the ﬁrst element of each sublist and picks the smaller value as the smallest element overall. This smaller value is removed from its sublist and placed into the output list. Merging continues in this way, comparing the front elements of the sublists and continually appending the smaller to the output list until no more input elements remain. Implementing Mergesort presents a number of technical difﬁculties. The ﬁrst decision is how to represent the lists. Mergesort lends itself well to sorting a singly linked list because merging does not require random access to the list elements. Thus, Mergesort is the method of choice when the input is in the form of a linked list. Implementing merge for linked lists is straightforward, because we need only remove items from the front of the input lists and append items to the output list. Breaking the input list into two equal halves presents some difﬁculty.Some of these algorithms are straightforward adaptations of schemes we use in everyday life. Others are totally alien to how hu- mans do things, having been invented to sort thousands or even millions of records stored on the computer. After years of study, there are still unsolved problems related to sorting. New algorithms are still being developed and reﬁned for special- purpose applications. While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for 223  224 Chap. 7 Internal Sorting special niche applications (Heapsort). Sorting provides an example of a signiﬁcant technique for analyzing the lower bound for a problem. Sorting will also be used to motivate the introduction to ﬁle processing presented in Chapter 8. The present chapter covers several standard algorithms appropriate for sorting a collection of records that ﬁt in the computer’s main memory. It begins with a dis- cussion of three simple, but relatively slow, algorithms requiring Θ(n2) time in the average and worst cases. Several algorithms with considerably better performance are then presented, some with Θ(n log n) worst-case running time. The ﬁnal sort- ing method presented requires only Θ(n) worst-case time under special conditions. The chapter concludes with a proof that sorting in general requires Ω(n log n) time in the worst case. 7.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation Except where noted otherwise, input to the sorting algorithms presented in this chapter is a collection of records stored in an array. Records are compared to one another by requiring that their type extend the Comparable class. This will ensure that the class implements the compareTo method, which returns a value less than zero, equal to zero, or greater than zero depending on its relationship to the record being compared to. The compareTo method is deﬁned to extract the appropriate key ﬁeld from the record. We also assume that for every record type there is a swap function that can interchange the contents of two records in the array. Given a set of records r1, r2, ..., rn with key values k1, k2, ..., kn, the Sorting Problem is to arrange the records into any order s such that records rs1, rs2, ..., rsn have keys obeying the property ks1 ≤ks2 ≤... ≤ksn. In other words, the sorting problem is to arrange a set of records so that the values of their key ﬁelds are in non-decreasing order. As deﬁned, the Sorting Problem allows input with two or more records that have the same key value. Certain applications require that input not contain duplicate key values. The sorting algorithms presented in this chapter and in Chapter 8 can handle duplicate key values unless noted otherwise. When duplicate key values are allowed, there might be an implicit ordering to the duplicates, typically based on their order of occurrence within the input. It might be desirable to maintain this initial ordering among duplicates. A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if it does not change the relative ordering of records with identical key values. Many, but not all, of the sorting algorithms presented in this chapter are stable, or can be made stable with minor changes. When comparing two sorting algorithms, the most straightforward approach would seem to be simply program both and measure their running times. An ex- ample of such timings is presented in Figure 7.20. However, such a comparison  Sec. 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms 225 can be misleading because the running time for many sorting algorithms depends on speciﬁcs of the input values. In particular, the number of records, the size of the keys and the records, the allowable range of the key values, and the amount by which the input records are “out of order” can all greatly affect the relative running times for sorting algorithms. When analyzing sorting algorithms, it is traditional to measure the number of comparisons made between keys. This measure is usually closely related to the running time for the algorithm and has the advantage of being machine and data- type independent. However, in some cases records might be so large that their physical movement might take a signiﬁcant fraction of the total running time. If so, it might be appropriate to measure the number of swap operations performed by the algorithm. In most applications we can assume that all records and keys are of ﬁxed length, and that a single comparison or a single swap operation requires a constant amount of time regardless of which keys are involved. Some special situations “change the rules” for comparing sorting algorithms. For example, an application with records or keys having widely varying length (such as sorting a sequence of variable length strings) will beneﬁt from a special-purpose sorting technique. Some applications require that a small number of records be sorted, but that the sort be performed frequently. An example would be an application that repeatedly sorts groups of ﬁve numbers. In such cases, the constants in the runtime equations that are usually ignored in an asymptotic analysis now become crucial. Finally, some situations require that a sorting algorithm use as little memory as possible. We will note which sorting algorithms require signiﬁcant extra memory beyond the input array. 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms This section presents three simple sorting algorithms. While easy to understand and implement, we will soon see that they are unacceptably slow when there are many records to sort..\n",
      "  - actual output: Here are the five most important learning concepts for the chapter on Internal Sorting: 1. **Sorting Algorithm Complexity**: Understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms is crucial. The chapter emphasizes that the worst-case time complexity for comparison-based sorting algorithms is Θ(n log n), which is a fundamental result in algorithm analysis. This means that no sorting algorithm can perform better than this bound in the worst case, providing a benchmark for evaluating sorting algorithms. 2. **Different Sorting Approaches**: The chapter discusses various sorting algorithms, including Mergesort, Quicksort, and others, highlighting their different approaches to sorting. For example, Mergesort uses a divide-and-conquer strategy by recursively splitting the list into halves, while Quicksort partitions the list into smaller and larger elements. Understanding these different methodologies is essential for selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the specific context and requirements. 3. **Stability in Sorting Algorithms**: The concept of stability in sorting algorithms is introduced, where a stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. This is important in applications where the order of records matters, and understanding which algorithms are stable and how to implement stability is a key learning point. 4. **Asymptotic Analysis and Misconceptions**: The chapter addresses common misunderstandings related to asymptotic analysis, which is a critical aspect of evaluating algorithm performance. It highlights the importance of grasping growth rates and the implications of upper and lower bounds in algorithm design, helping students avoid misconceptions that can arise from oversimplified interpretations of algorithm efficiency. 5. **Practical Implementation Challenges**: The chapter discusses the practical challenges of implementing sorting algorithms, particularly Mergesort, which, despite its conceptual simplicity, can be difficult to implement effectively. This includes considerations for data structures (e.g., arrays vs. linked lists) and the technical difficulties in merging sorted lists. Understanding these challenges is vital for applying theoretical knowledge to real-world programming scenarios. These concepts collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of internal sorting, its complexities, and practical considerations, forming a solid foundation for further study in algorithm design and analysis.\n",

The ﬁrst row shows eight numbers that are to be sorted. Mergesort will recursively subdivide the list into sublists of one element each, then recombine the sublists. The second row shows the four sublists of size 2 created by the ﬁrst merging pass. The third row shows the two sublists of size 4 created by the next merging pass on the sublists of row 2. The last row shows the ﬁnal sorted list created by merging the two sublists of row 3. Mergesort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms conceptually, and has good performance both in the asymptotic sense and in empirical running time. Surpris- ingly, even though it is based on a simple concept, it is relatively difﬁcult to im- plement in practice. Figure 7.8 illustrates Mergesort. A pseudocode sketch of Mergesort is as follows: List mergesort(List inlist) { if (inlist.length() <= 1) return inlist;; List L1 = half of the items from inlist; List L2 = other half of the items from inlist; return merge(mergesort(L1), mergesort(L2)); } Before discussing how to implement Mergesort, we will ﬁrst examine the merge function. Merging two sorted sublists is quite simple. Function merge examines the ﬁrst element of each sublist and picks the smaller value as the smallest element overall. This smaller value is removed from its sublist and placed into the output list. Merging continues in this way, comparing the front elements of the sublists and continually appending the smaller to the output list until no more input elements remain. Implementing Mergesort presents a number of technical difﬁculties. The ﬁrst decision is how to represent the lists. Mergesort lends itself well to sorting a singly linked list because merging does not require random access to the list elements. Thus, Mergesort is the method of choice when the input is in the form of a linked list. Implementing merge for linked lists is straightforward, because we need only remove items from the front of the input lists and append items to the output list. Breaking the input list into two equal halves presents some difﬁculty.These assumptions can be  284 Chap. 8 File Processing and External Sorting relaxed for special-purpose sorting applications, but ignoring such complications makes the principles clearer. As explained in Section 8.2, a sector is the basic unit of I/O. In other words, all disk reads and writes are for one or more complete sectors. Sector sizes are typically a power of two, in the range 512 to 16K bytes, depending on the operating system and the size and speed of the disk drive. The block size used for external sorting algorithms should be equal to or a multiple of the sector size. Under this model, a sorting algorithm reads a block of data into a buffer in main memory, performs some processing on it, and at some future time writes it back to disk. From Section 8.1 we see that reading or writing a block from disk takes on the order of one million times longer than a memory access. Based on this fact, we can reasonably expect that the records contained in a single block can be sorted by an internal sorting algorithm such as Quicksort in less time than is required to read or write the block. Under good conditions, reading from a ﬁle in sequential order is more efﬁcient than reading blocks in random order. Given the signiﬁcant impact of seek time on disk access, it might seem obvious that sequential processing is faster. However, it is important to understand precisely under what circumstances sequential ﬁle processing is actually faster than random access, because it affects our approach to designing an external sorting algorithm. Efﬁcient sequential access relies on seek time being kept to a minimum. The ﬁrst requirement is that the blocks making up a ﬁle are in fact stored on disk in sequential order and close together, preferably ﬁlling a small number of contiguous tracks. At the very least, the number of extents making up the ﬁle should be small. Users typically do not have much control over the layout of their ﬁle on disk, but writing a ﬁle all at once in sequential order to a disk drive with a high percentage of free space increases the likelihood of such an arrangement. The second requirement is that the disk drive’s I/O head remain positioned over the ﬁle throughout sequential processing. This will not happen if there is competition of any kind for the I/O head. For example, on a multi-user time-shared computer the sorting process might compete for the I/O head with the processes of other users. Even when the sorting process has sole control of the I/O head, it is still likely that sequential processing will not be efﬁcient. Imagine the situation where all processing is done on a single disk drive, with the typical arrangement of a single bank of read/write heads that move together over a stack of platters. If the sorting process involves reading from an input ﬁle, alternated with writing to an output ﬁle, then the I/O head will continuously seek between the input ﬁle and the output ﬁle. Similarly, if two input ﬁles are being processed simultaneously (such as during a merge process), then the I/O head will continuously seek between these two ﬁles. Sec. 8.5 External Sorting 285 The moral is that, with a single disk drive, there often is no such thing as efﬁ- cient sequential processing of a data ﬁle. Thus, a sorting algorithm might be more efﬁcient if it performs a smaller number of non-sequential disk operations rather than a larger number of logically sequential disk operations that require a large number of seeks in practice. As mentioned previously, the record size might be quite large compared to the size of the key.Trees are typically used to or- ganize large databases that must support record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Section 10.2 brieﬂy describes ISAM, a tentative step toward solving the problem of storing a large database that must support insertion and deletion of records. Its shortcomings help to illustrate the value of tree indexing techniques..', actual_output='Here are the five most important learning concepts for the chapter on File Processing and External Sorting, particularly in the context of tree indexing methods and the implementation of sorting algorithms: 1. **Mergesort Algorithm**: Understanding the Mergesort algorithm is crucial as it is a fundamental external sorting technique. The recursive nature of Mergesort, where the list is divided into smaller sublists and then merged back together, highlights the importance of efficient merging processes. The pseudocode provided illustrates how Mergesort operates, emphasizing its conceptual simplicity and practical challenges. 2. **External Sorting vs. Internal Sorting**: The distinction between external and internal sorting is vital. External sorting is necessary when dealing with data that cannot fit into main memory, requiring the use of disk storage. The chapter discusses how external sorting algorithms, like Mergesort, are designed to minimize disk I/O operations, which are significantly slower than memory accesses. 3. **Disk I/O and Buffer Management**: Understanding the impact of disk I/O on performance is essential. The chapter explains that reading and writing data in blocks (or sectors) is more efficient than random access. Efficient buffer management and the organization of data on disk can greatly affect the performance of sorting algorithms, making it important to consider how data is laid out on disk. 4. **Sequential vs. Random Access**: The chapter emphasizes the conditions under which sequential file processing is more efficient than random access. It discusses the importance of minimizing seek time and ensuring that data blocks are stored contiguously on disk. This understanding is critical for designing efficient external sorting algorithms that leverage sequential access patterns. 5. **Tree Indexing Methods**: The chapter introduces tree indexing methods as a means to organize large databases that require efficient record insertion, deletion, and key range searches. Understanding the role of tree structures in indexing and their relationship to sorting and searching operations is important for implementing the Dictionary ADT and optimizing data retrieval processes. These concepts collectively provide a foundational understanding of file processing and external sorting, highlighting the interplay between algorithm design, data organization, and system performance.', expected_output='Data Structures Basics Algorithm Analysis O Notation Algorithms Non-recursive Algorthims Non-recursive Algorithms Search Linear Search Binary Search Sort Insertion Sort Selection Sort Bubble Sort Recursive Algorithms Recursive Binary Search Recursive Sort Merge Sort Quick Sort', context=None, retrieval_context=['Tree indexing methods.

The relevant context can be found here: Under extreme conditions, many searches might eventually lead to the system overﬂow area. The “solution” to this problem is to periodically reorganize the entire database. This means re-balancing the records 1Recall from Section 8.2.1 that a cylinder is all of the tracks readable from a particular placement of the heads on the multiple platters of a disk drive. 348 Chap. 10 Indexing among the cylinders, sorting the records within each cylinder, and updating both the system index table and the within-cylinder block table. Such reorganization was typical of database systems during the 1960s and would normally be done each night or weekly. 10.3 Tree-based Indexing Linear indexing is efﬁcient when the database is static, that is, when records are inserted and deleted rarely or never. ISAM is adequate for a limited number of updates, but not for frequent changes. Because it has essentially two levels of indexing, ISAM will also break down for a truly large database where the number of cylinders is too great for the top-level index to ﬁt in main memory. In their most general form, database applications have the following character- istics: 1.10 Chap. 1 Data Structures and Algorithms One application that makes use of some ADT might use particular member functions of that ADT more than a second application, or the two applications might have different time requirements for the various operations. These differences in the requirements of applications are the reason why a given ADT might be supported by more than one implementation. Example 1.5 Two popular implementations for large disk-based database applications are hashing (Section 9.4) and the B+-tree (Section 10.5). Both support efﬁcient insertion and deletion of records, and both support exact- match queries. However, hashing is more efﬁcient than the B+-tree for exact-match queries. On the other hand, the B+-tree can perform range queries efﬁciently, while hashing is hopelessly inefﬁcient for range queries. Thus, if the database application limits searches to exact-match queries, hashing is preferred. On the other hand, if the application requires support for range queries, the B+-tree is preferred. Despite these performance is- sues, both implementations solve versions of the same problem: updating and searching a large collection of records. The concept of an ADT can help us to focus on key issues even in non-comp- uting applications. Example 1.6 When operating a car, the primary activities are steering, accelerating, and braking. On nearly all passenger cars, you steer by turn- ing the steering wheel, accelerate by pushing the gas pedal, and brake by pushing the brake pedal. This design for cars can be viewed as an ADT with operations “steer,” “accelerate,” and “brake.” Two cars might imple- ment these operations in radically different ways, say with different types of engine, or front- versus rear-wheel drive. Yet, most drivers can oper- ate many different cars because the ADT presents a uniform method of operation that does not require the driver to understand the speciﬁcs of any particular engine or drive design. These differences are deliberately hidden.Notice that the splaying process has made the tree shallower. 13.3 Spatial Data Structures All of the search trees discussed so far — BSTs, AVL trees, splay trees, 2-3 trees, B-trees, and tries — are designed for searching on a one-dimensional key. A typical example is an integer key, whose one-dimensional range can be visualized as a number line. These various tree structures can be viewed as dividing this one- dimensional number line into pieces. Some databases require support for multiple keys. In other words, records can be searched for using any one of several key ﬁelds, such as name or ID number. Typically, each such key has its own one-dimensional index, and any given search query searches one of these independent indices as appropriate. A multidimensional search key presents a rather different concept. Imagine that we have a database of city records, where each city has a name and an xy- coordinate. A BST or splay tree provides good performance for searches on city name, which is a one-dimensional key. Separate BSTs could be used to index the x- and y-coordinates. This would allow us to insert and delete cities, and locate them by name or by one coordinate. However, search on one of the two coordinates is not a natural way to view search in a two-dimensional space. Another option is to combine the xy-coordinates into a single key, say by concatenating the two coor- dinates, and index cities by the resulting key in a BST. That would allow search by coordinate, but would not allow for efﬁcient two-dimensional range queries such as searching for all cities within a given distance of a speciﬁed point. The problem is that the BST only works well for one-dimensional keys, while a coordinate is a two-dimensional key where neither dimension is more important than the other. Multidimensional range queries are the deﬁning feature of a spatial applica- tion.The classic example is a large database of records with multiple search keys, requiring the ability to insert, delete, and search for records. Hashing provides outstanding performance for such situations, but only in the limited case in which all searches are of the form “ﬁnd the record with key value K.” Many applications require more general search capabilities. One exam- ple is a range query search for all records whose key lies within some range. Other queries might involve visiting all records in order of their key value, or ﬁnding the record with the greatest key value. Hash tables are not organized to support any of these queries efﬁciently. This chapter introduces ﬁle structures used to organize a large collection of records stored on disk. Such ﬁle structures support efﬁcient insertion, deletion, and search operations, for exact-match queries, range queries, and largest/smallest key value searches. Before discussing such ﬁle structures, we must become familiar with some ba- sic ﬁle-processing terminology. An entry-sequenced ﬁle stores records in the order that they were added to the ﬁle. Entry-sequenced ﬁles are the disk-based equivalent to an unsorted list and so do not support efﬁcient search. The natural solution is to sort the records by order of the search key. However, a typical database, such as a collection of employee or customer records maintained by a business, might con- tain multiple search keys. To answer a question about a particular customer might require a search on the name of the customer. Businesses often wish to sort and output the records by zip code order for a bulk mailing. Government paperwork might require the ability to search by Social Security number. Thus, there might not be a single “correct” order in which to store the records. Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 341  342 Chap. 10 Indexing could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld. Each record of a database normally has a unique identiﬁer, called the primary key. For example, the primary key for a set of personnel records might be the Social Security number or ID number for the individual. Unfortunately, the ID number is generally an inconvenient value on which to perform a search because the searcher is unlikely to know it. Instead, the searcher might know the desired employee’s name. Alternatively, the searcher might be interested in ﬁnding all employees whose salary is in a certain range. If these are typical search requests to the database, then the name and salary ﬁelds deserve separate indices. However, key values in the name and salary indices are not likely to be unique. A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index. Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4. A simple list sorted by key value can also serve as an index to the record ﬁle. Indexing disk ﬁles by sorted lists are discussed in the following section. Unfortunately, a sorted list does not perform well for insert and delete operations.

important learning concepts for chapter Searching. The relevant context can be found here: Select the data structure that best meets these requirements. This three-step approach to selecting a data structure operationalizes a data- centered view of the design process. The ﬁrst concern is for the data and the op- erations to be performed on them, the next concern is the representation for those data, and the ﬁnal concern is the implementation of that representation. Resource constraints on certain key operations, such as search, inserting data records, and deleting data records, normally drive the data structure selection pro- cess. Many issues relating to the relative importance of these operations are ad- dressed by the following three questions, which you should ask yourself whenever you must choose a data structure:  6 Chap. 1 Data Structures and Algorithms • Are all data items inserted into the data structure at the beginning, or are insertions interspersed with other operations? Static applications (where the data are loaded at the beginning and never change) typically require only simpler data structures to get an efﬁcient implementation than do dynamic applications. • Can data items be deleted?Only when you have to organize and search through a large number of things do more sophisticated data structures usually become necessary. (We will study how to organize and search through medium amounts of data in Chapters 5, 7, and 9, and discuss how to deal with large amounts of data in Chapters 8–10.) Many applications don’t require any form of search, and they do not require that any or- dering be placed on the objects being stored. Some applications require processing in a strict chronological order, processing objects in the order that they arrived, or perhaps processing objects in the reverse of the order that they arrived. For all these situations, a simple list structure is appropriate. This chapter describes representations for lists in general, as well as two impor- tant list-like structures called the stack and the queue. Along with presenting these fundamental data structures, the other goals of the chapter are to: (1) Give examples of separating a logical representation in the form of an ADT from a physical im- plementation for a data structure. (2) Illustrate the use of asymptotic analysis in the context of some simple operations that you might already be familiar with. In this way you can begin to see how asymptotic analysis works, without the complica- tions that arise when analyzing more sophisticated algorithms and data structures. (3) Introduce the concept and use of dictionaries.The classic example is a large database of records with multiple search keys, requiring the ability to insert, delete, and search for records. Hashing provides outstanding performance for such situations, but only in the limited case in which all searches are of the form “ﬁnd the record with key value K.” Many applications require more general search capabilities. One exam- ple is a range query search for all records whose key lies within some range. Other queries might involve visiting all records in order of their key value, or ﬁnding the record with the greatest key value. Hash tables are not organized to support any of these queries efﬁciently. This chapter introduces ﬁle structures used to organize a large collection of records stored on disk. Such ﬁle structures support efﬁcient insertion, deletion, and search operations, for exact-match queries, range queries, and largest/smallest key value searches. Before discussing such ﬁle structures, we must become familiar with some ba- sic ﬁle-processing terminology. An entry-sequenced ﬁle stores records in the order that they were added to the ﬁle. Entry-sequenced ﬁles are the disk-based equivalent to an unsorted list and so do not support efﬁcient search. The natural solution is to sort the records by order of the search key. However, a typical database, such as a collection of employee or customer records maintained by a business, might con- tain multiple search keys. To answer a question about a particular customer might require a search on the name of the customer. Businesses often wish to sort and output the records by zip code order for a bulk mailing. Government paperwork might require the ability to search by Social Security number. Thus, there might not be a single “correct” order in which to store the records. Indexing is the process of associating a key with the location of a correspond- ing data record. Section 8.5 discussed the concept of a key sort, in which an index ﬁle is created whose records consist of key/pointer pairs. Here, each key is asso- ciated with a pointer to a complete record in the main database ﬁle. The index ﬁle 341  342 Chap. 10 Indexing could be sorted or organized using a tree structure, thereby imposing a logical or- der on the records without physically rearranging them. One database might have several associated index ﬁles, each supporting efﬁcient access through a different key ﬁeld. Each record of a database normally has a unique identiﬁer, called the primary key. For example, the primary key for a set of personnel records might be the Social Security number or ID number for the individual. Unfortunately, the ID number is generally an inconvenient value on which to perform a search because the searcher is unlikely to know it. Instead, the searcher might know the desired employee’s name. Alternatively, the searcher might be interested in ﬁnding all employees whose salary is in a certain range. If these are typical search requests to the database, then the name and salary ﬁelds deserve separate indices. However, key values in the name and salary indices are not likely to be unique. A key ﬁeld such as salary, where a particular key value might be duplicated in multiple records, is called a secondary key. Most searches are performed using a secondary key. The secondary key index (or more simply, secondary index) will associate a secondary key value with the primary key of each record having that secondary key value. At this point, the full database might be searched directly for the record with that primary key, or there might be a primary key index (or primary index) that relates each primary key value with a pointer to the actual record on disk. In the latter case, only the primary index provides the location of the actual record on disk, while the secondary indices refer to the primary index. Indexing is an important technique for organizing large databases, and many indexing methods have been developed. Direct access through hashing is discussed in Section 9.4.

Sorting. The relevant context can be found here: We must be careful about how we interpret this last statement, however. The world is certainly better off for the invention of Quicksort, even though Mergesort was available at the time. Quicksort is not asymptotically faster than Mergesort, yet is not merely a “tuning” of Mergesort either. Quicksort is a substantially different approach to sorting. So even when our upper and lower bounds for a problem meet, there are still beneﬁts to be gained from a new, clever algorithm.Many have tried, without success. Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately?), Chapter 7 also includes a proof that any sorting algorithm must have running time in Ω(n log n) in the worst case.2 This proof is one of the most important results in the ﬁeld of algorithm analysis, and it means that no sorting algorithm can possibly run faster than cn log n for the worst-case input of size n. Thus, we can conclude that the problem of sorting is Θ(n log n) in the worst case, because the upper and lower bounds have met. Knowing the lower bound for a problem does not give you a good algorithm. But it does help you to know when to stop looking. If the lower bound for the problem matches the upper bound for the algorithm (within a constant factor), then we know that we can ﬁnd an algorithm that is better only by a constant factor. 3.7 Common Misunderstandings Asymptotic analysis is one of the most intellectually difﬁcult topics that undergrad- uate computer science majors are confronted with. Most people ﬁnd growth rates and asymptotic analysis confusing and so develop misconceptions about either the concepts or the terminology.234 Chap. 7 Internal Sorting 36 20 17 13 28 14 23 15 28 23 15 14 36 20 17 13 20 36 13 17 14 28 15 23 13 14 15 17 20 23 28 36 Figure 7.8 An illustration of Mergesort. The ﬁrst row shows eight numbers that are to be sorted. Mergesort will recursively subdivide the list into sublists of one element each, then recombine the sublists. The second row shows the four sublists of size 2 created by the ﬁrst merging pass. The third row shows the two sublists of size 4 created by the next merging pass on the sublists of row 2. The last row shows the ﬁnal sorted list created by merging the two sublists of row 3. Mergesort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms conceptually, and has good performance both in the asymptotic sense and in empirical running time. Surpris- ingly, even though it is based on a simple concept, it is relatively difﬁcult to im- plement in practice. Figure 7.8 illustrates Mergesort. A pseudocode sketch of Mergesort is as follows: List mergesort(List inlist) { if (inlist.length() <= 1) return inlist;; List L1 = half of the items from inlist; List L2 = other half of the items from inlist; return merge(mergesort(L1), mergesort(L2)); } Before discussing how to implement Mergesort, we will ﬁrst examine the merge function. Merging two sorted sublists is quite simple. Function merge examines the ﬁrst element of each sublist and picks the smaller value as the smallest element overall. This smaller value is removed from its sublist and placed into the output list. Merging continues in this way, comparing the front elements of the sublists and continually appending the smaller to the output list until no more input elements remain. Implementing Mergesort presents a number of technical difﬁculties. The ﬁrst decision is how to represent the lists. Mergesort lends itself well to sorting a singly linked list because merging does not require random access to the list elements. Thus, Mergesort is the method of choice when the input is in the form of a linked list. Implementing merge for linked lists is straightforward, because we need only remove items from the front of the input lists and append items to the output list. Breaking the input list into two equal halves presents some difﬁculty.Some of these algorithms are straightforward adaptations of schemes we use in everyday life. Others are totally alien to how hu- mans do things, having been invented to sort thousands or even millions of records stored on the computer. After years of study, there are still unsolved problems related to sorting. New algorithms are still being developed and reﬁned for special- purpose applications. While introducing this central problem in computer science, this chapter has a secondary purpose of illustrating issues in algorithm design and analysis. For example, this collection of sorting algorithms shows multiple approaches to us- ing divide-and-conquer. In particular, there are multiple ways to do the dividing: Mergesort divides a list in half; Quicksort divides a list into big values and small values; and Radix Sort divides the problem by working on one digit of the key at a time. Sorting algorithms can also illustrate a wide variety of analysis techniques. We’ll ﬁnd that it is possible for an algorithm to have an average case whose growth rate is signiﬁcantly smaller than its worse case (Quicksort). We’ll see how it is possible to speed up sorting algorithms (both Shellsort and Quicksort) by taking advantage of the best case behavior of another algorithm (Insertion sort). We’ll see several examples of how we can tune an algorithm for better performance. We’ll see that special case behavior by some algorithms makes them a good solution for 223  224 Chap. 7 Internal Sorting special niche applications (Heapsort). Sorting provides an example of a signiﬁcant technique for analyzing the lower bound for a problem. Sorting will also be used to motivate the introduction to ﬁle processing presented in Chapter 8. The present chapter covers several standard algorithms appropriate for sorting a collection of records that ﬁt in the computer’s main memory. It begins with a dis- cussion of three simple, but relatively slow, algorithms requiring Θ(n2) time in the average and worst cases. Several algorithms with considerably better performance are then presented, some with Θ(n log n) worst-case running time. The ﬁnal sort- ing method presented requires only Θ(n) worst-case time under special conditions. The chapter concludes with a proof that sorting in general requires Ω(n log n) time in the worst case. 7.1 Sorting Terminology and Notation Except where noted otherwise, input to the sorting algorithms presented in this chapter is a collection of records stored in an array. Records are compared to one another by requiring that their type extend the Comparable class. This will ensure that the class implements the compareTo method, which returns a value less than zero, equal to zero, or greater than zero depending on its relationship to the record being compared to. The compareTo method is deﬁned to extract the appropriate key ﬁeld from the record. We also assume that for every record type there is a swap function that can interchange the contents of two records in the array. Given a set of records r1, r2, ..., rn with key values k1, k2, ..., kn, the Sorting Problem is to arrange the records into any order s such that records rs1, rs2, ..., rsn have keys obeying the property ks1 ≤ks2 ≤... ≤ksn. In other words, the sorting problem is to arrange a set of records so that the values of their key ﬁelds are in non-decreasing order. As deﬁned, the Sorting Problem allows input with two or more records that have the same key value. Certain applications require that input not contain duplicate key values. The sorting algorithms presented in this chapter and in Chapter 8 can handle duplicate key values unless noted otherwise. When duplicate key values are allowed, there might be an implicit ordering to the duplicates, typically based on their order of occurrence within the input. It might be desirable to maintain this initial ordering among duplicates. A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if it does not change the relative ordering of records with identical key values. Many, but not all, of the sorting algorithms presented in this chapter are stable, or can be made stable with minor changes. When comparing two sorting algorithms, the most straightforward approach would seem to be simply program both and measure their running times. An ex- ample of such timings is presented in Figure 7.20. However, such a comparison  Sec. 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms 225 can be misleading because the running time for many sorting algorithms depends on speciﬁcs of the input values. In particular, the number of records, the size of the keys and the records, the allowable range of the key values, and the amount by which the input records are “out of order” can all greatly affect the relative running times for sorting algorithms. When analyzing sorting algorithms, it is traditional to measure the number of comparisons made between keys. This measure is usually closely related to the running time for the algorithm and has the advantage of being machine and data- type independent. However, in some cases records might be so large that their physical movement might take a signiﬁcant fraction of the total running time. If so, it might be appropriate to measure the number of swap operations performed by the algorithm. In most applications we can assume that all records and keys are of ﬁxed length, and that a single comparison or a single swap operation requires a constant amount of time regardless of which keys are involved. Some special situations “change the rules” for comparing sorting algorithms. For example, an application with records or keys having widely varying length (such as sorting a sequence of variable length strings) will beneﬁt from a special-purpose sorting technique. Some applications require that a small number of records be sorted, but that the sort be performed frequently. An example would be an application that repeatedly sorts groups of ﬁve numbers. In such cases, the constants in the runtime equations that are usually ignored in an asymptotic analysis now become crucial. Finally, some situations require that a sorting algorithm use as little memory as possible. We will note which sorting algorithms require signiﬁcant extra memory beyond the input array. 7.2 Three Θ(n2) Sorting Algorithms This section presents three simple sorting algorithms. While easy to understand and implement, we will soon see that they are unacceptably slow when there are many records to sort..', actual_output='Here are the five most important learning concepts for the chapter on Internal Sorting: 1. **Sorting Algorithm Complexity**: Understanding the time complexity of sorting algorithms is crucial. The chapter emphasizes that the worst-case time complexity for comparison-based sorting algorithms is Θ(n log n), which is a fundamental result in algorithm analysis. This means that no sorting algorithm can perform better than this bound in the worst case, providing a benchmark for evaluating sorting algorithms. 2. **Different Sorting Approaches**: The chapter discusses various sorting algorithms, including Mergesort, Quicksort, and others, highlighting their different approaches to sorting. For example, Mergesort uses a divide-and-conquer strategy by recursively splitting the list into halves, while Quicksort partitions the list into smaller and larger elements. Understanding these different methodologies is essential for selecting the appropriate algorithm based on the specific context and requirements. 3. **Stability in Sorting Algorithms**: The concept of stability in sorting algorithms is introduced, where a stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of records with equal keys. This is important in applications where the order of records matters, and understanding which algorithms are stable and how to implement stability is a key learning point. 4. **Asymptotic Analysis and Misconceptions**: The chapter addresses common misunderstandings related to asymptotic analysis, which is a critical aspect of evaluating algorithm performance. It highlights the importance of grasping growth rates and the implications of upper and lower bounds in algorithm design, helping students avoid misconceptions that can arise from oversimplified interpretations of algorithm efficiency. 5. **Practical Implementation Challenges**: The chapter discusses the practical challenges of implementing sorting algorithms, particularly Mergesort, which, despite its conceptual simplicity, can be difficult to implement effectively. This includes considerations for data structures (e.g., arrays vs. linked lists) and the technical difficulties in merging sorted lists. Understanding these challenges is vital for applying theoretical knowledge to real-world programming scenarios. These concepts collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of internal sorting, its complexities, and practical considerations, forming a solid foundation for further study in algorithm design and analysis.', expected_output='Data Structures Basics Algorithm Analysis O Notation Algorithms Non-recursive Algorthims Non-recursive Algorithms Search Linear Search Binary Search Sort Insertion Sort Selection Sort Bubble Sort Recursive Algorithms Recursive Binary Search Recursive Sort Merge Sort Quick Sort', context=None, retrieval_context=['We must be careful about how we interpret this last statement, however.
